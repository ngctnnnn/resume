"A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?
Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization or Complication of the IVC filter placement or Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve or Hematoma of the left thigh.","### Answer: Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
### Explanation: Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve supplies the skin overlying the gluteal region and medial side of the leg. It arises from ventral divisions of lumbar spinal nerves L2, L3, and L4. Injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can result in loss of sensory function over the affected dermatome. This injury could be caused by trauma, surgery, or compression due to entrapment neuropathy. Cerebral infarcts usually present with focal deficits involving language, motor skills, and memory. Infusion of heparin into the portal vein can lead to bleeding complications but does not involve direct pressure on peripheral nerves. Placement of an IVC filter is associated with risk of migration of the device through the venous system and obstruction of blood flow. Warfarin use leads to prolonged coagulation times and increased risk of bleeding.
Diagnosis: Decreased sensation secondary to lateral femoral cutaneous nerve compression
""The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin overlying the gluteal region and medial side of the leg. Injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can result in loss of sensory function over the affected dermatomes."" -",Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
"A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is
Braxton Hicks contractions or lower uterine retraction ring or hypotonic uterine dysfunction or primary dysfunctional labor.","### Answer: hypotonic uterine dysfunction
### Explanation: Hypotonic uterine dysfunction (HUD), also known as hypertonic uterine dysfunction, refers to an abnormality that occurs during pregnancy when the muscles of the uterus become overactive and contract too strongly. This can cause complications during childbih, including premature delivery.
The exact causes of HUD are not fully understood. However, it appears that hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy play a role. In addition, women who have experienced previous miscarriages or stillbihs may be at increased risk of developing HUD.
Symptoms of HUD include frequent contractions, pelvic pressure, backache, vaginal discharge, and bleeding. If left untreated, HUD can lead to premature birth, low bih weight, placenta previa, and other serious problems.
Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms. Mild cases often resolve spontaneously within several hours. More severe cases require medical treatment. Treatment options include sedatives, narcotic analgesics, epidural blockade, and oxytocin infusion.
In rare instances, cesarean section may be necessary if there is evidence of fetal distress.
Complications associated with HUD include prematurity, low bih weight, placenta previa, and postpaum hemorrhage.
Prevention of HUD includes adequate prenatal care, avoidance of excessive physical activity, and management of stress.

"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?
The findings are clinically and statistically significant or The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant or The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant or The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant.","### Answer: The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant
### Explanation: Statistical significance does not necessarily imply clinical significance. In this case, the difference between groups is small enough that it would be unlikely to have any practical importance. However, if the sample size had been larger, the difference might well have reached statistical significance even though there were no real differences between the two groups.
A p value less than 0.05 indicates that the probability that the observed difference occurred by chance alone is less than 5%. This means that the null hypothesis can be rejected only when the calculated p value is below 0.05. If the p value is greater than 0.05, then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected; therefore, the data fail to show a significant difference between the two groups.
In this example, the p value is 0.04, which falls within the range of 0.001–0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis can be rejected, indicating that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant. However, since the difference is very small, the result has little clinical significance.
If the p value is 0.06, then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, meaning that the difference between the two groups is not statistically significant. Even though the difference between the two groups is still present, it is too small to be considered important from a clinical perspective.
A confidence interval is used to estimate the true population parameter. For instance, if we want to know how much weight an average adult male gains during pregnancy, we could use a confidence interval to estimate the amount of weight gained. We would take all the measurements obtained from our sample group and calculate the mean weight gain. Then, we would add or subtract a certain number of standard deviations from the mean weight gain to obtain the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval. These values represent the range of possible weights gained by males in the entire population.
For example, suppose we wanted to determine the percentage increase in blood pressure after standing up from lying down. To obtain this information, we measured the blood pressures of 10 individuals before they stood up and again immediately afterward. Their mean change in systolic blood pressure was +19 mm Hg. Since their standard deviation was 10 mm Hg, we added ±1 SD to the mean change in systolic blood pressure. Thus, the lower limit of the confidence interval was 19 – 2 × 10 = 19 – 20 = -1 and the upper limit was 19 + 2 × 10 = 19 + 20 = 41. These values indicate the minimum and maximum percent changes in blood pressure that could occur among all healthy men who stand up suddenly.
Thus, the confidence interval provides us with a range of values that define the expected outcome. It gives us a way to make predictions based on past observations.
Key Concept:
Statistical significance does not necessarily imply clinical significance.

"A 9-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents for a well-child examination. The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
Atrial fibrillation or Cor pulmonale or Systemic hypertension or Tricuspid valve regurgitation.","### Answer: Atrial fibrillation
### Explanation: Mitral stenosis can lead to atrial fibrillation because of increased pressures within the left atrium. Left untreated, this condition can result in congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and cor pulmonale. Patients with mitral stenosis have an increased incidence of systemic emboli due to hypercoagulable states that occur secondary to left atrial enlargement. In patients who develop severe obstruction, tricuspid insufficiency can ensue. Pulmonary arteries dilate in response to right ventricular overload from mitral stenosis. However, these changes usually take many years to evolve.

"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?
Median nerve at the wrist or Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm or Radial nerve at the forearm or Ulnar nerve at the elbow.","### Answer: Median nerve at the wrist
### Explanation: Carpal tunnel syndrome results from compression of the median nerve between the flexor retinaculum and carpal bones. This condition can be caused by repetitive motion (e.g., typing), pregnancy, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, acromegaly, amyloidosis, leukemia, menopause, and myxedema. Symptoms include paresthesias that radiate into the palmar aspect of the thumb and first two digits; weakness of thenar muscles; and sensory loss along the distribution of the median nerve. Painful electric shock-like sensations occur when the wrist is passively extended. Tapping over the volar surface of the wrist reproduces symptoms. Treatment includes rest, splinting, physical therapy, corticosteroid injection, and surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament.Diagnosis: Carpal tunnel syndrome
Clinical presentation: Paresthesia in the distal third of the radial side of the hand, including the index and middle fingers
Anatomic location: Compression of the superficial branch of the radial nerve at the supinator split
Treatment: Rest, antiinflammatory agents, and avoidance of aggravating activities
Complications: Chronic pressure neuropathy, permanent disability
Other options:
Option B: Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve would result in paralysis of the coracobrachialis and short head of the biceps brachii.
Option C: Injury to the radial nerve would produce paralysis of the triceps brachii and anhydrosis due to interruption of sympathetic innervation to the skin.
Option D: Injury to the ulnar nerve would produce paralysis of the flexors of the forearm and hand, leading to clawing of the hands.

"Six healthy subjects participate in a study of muscle metabolism during which hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia is induced. Muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?
Fatty acid oxidation or Fatty acid synthesis or Gluconeogenesis or Glycogenolysis.","### Answer: Fatty acid oxidation
### Explanation: Increased levels of malonyl-CoA inhibit carboxylase (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), an enzyme that catalyzes the first committed reaction in fatty acid biosynthesis. This results in decreased acetyl-CoA availability to the citric acid cycle, thereby reducing the rate of glucose utilization. Malonyl-CoA does not affect glycolysis, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, or fatty acid synthesis.
Glucagon stimulation increases lipolysis and ketone body production; it has no effect on lipogenesis. Glucocorticoids increase lipolysis but have little effect on lipogenesis. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis and inhibits lipolysis. Thyroid hormones increase basal rates of both lipogenesis and lipolysis. Estrogens promote lipogenesis and decrease lipolysis. Androgen deficiency leads to decreased lipogenesis and increased lipolysis.

"A 72-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer metastatic to the liver is brought to the physician by her son because she cries all the time and will not get out of bed. On a 10-point scale, she rates the pain as a 1 to 2. She also has hypertension and major depressive disorder. She has received chemotherapy for 2 years. Current medications also include oxycodone (10 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d), and fluoxetine (20 mg/d). She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Examination shows a firm, distended abdomen with moderate tenderness over the liver. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She has good eye contact but appears sad and cries easily. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Reassurance or Assess for suicidal ideation or Begin dextroamphetamine therapy or Increase oxycodone dosage.","### Answer: Assess for suicidal ideation
### Explanation: This patient has symptoms consistent with depression that have developed during treatment for an advanced illness. Depression can be treated concurrently with other medical conditions. However, it must be recognized early and managed appropriately. Suicidal thoughts require immediate attention; if present, they take precedence over any physical complaints. If this patient were experiencing severe pain, opioid analgesics would be indicated. Antidepressants are effective treatments for depression. Amphetamines are used primarily for ADHD.

Section IV. Malignant Epithelial Ovary
Subsection III. Metastasis
Morphology
Metastases from epithelial tumors of the ovary usually occur through the lymphatics and bloodstream. They appear as small nodules within the substance of organs, especially those having a rich vascular supply. These lesions often resemble primary neoplasms histologically.
The presence of multiple metastases does not necessarily indicate widespread disease. For example, patients who survived long periods after undergoing surgical removal of large pelvic masses had numerous metastases throughout their bodies.
In addition, many patients whose only evidence of disease was a single metastasis lived for several years before dying of unrelated causes.
These observations suggest that prognostic factors other than extent of spread play important roles in determining outcome.

"A 65-year-old woman has a 6-month history of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. She has had a neck mass for more than 10 years. 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis or Graves' disease or Multinodular goiter or Riedel's thyroiditis.","### Answer: Defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis
### Explanation: This patient has Graves' disease, which causes hyperthyroidism through excess TSH receptor stimulation. However, she also has a multinodular goiter that contains cold nodules from defective iodide trapping and hot spots from hormone production. In addition to her hypermetabolic state, she probably would have hypothyroidism if all of her follicles were destroyed because of lack of iodide. Thyrotropes can be induced to produce TSH receptors in vitro; this process is called TSH receptor expression.

Enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake
Riedel's thyroiditis results from fibrosis of the entire thyroid gland secondary to metastatic spread of malignant cells into the thyroid. It presents with painful swelling of the neck and dysphagia. Diagnosis is made on biopsy. Treatment involves surgery and radiation therapy.
Multinodular goiter occurs when there are two or more nodules within the same lobe of the thyroid gland. It usually does not cause symptoms unless it becomes large enough to compress surrounding structures. Surgery is indicated only if symptomatic.
Toxic adenoma is a solitary nodule that produces excess thyroid hormones. It is associated with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and is treated by removal of the affected lobe.
Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis is caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and leukopenia. Symptoms resolve over several weeks but may recur after stress. Hypothyroidism develops slowly and requires treatment.
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that leads to destruction of the thyroid tissue. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia and type I diabetes mellitus. Antithyroid antibody levels correlate well with clinical activity.
Primary thyroid carcinomas include papillary, medullary, and anaplastic types. Papillary cancer is common in young women and tends to remain localized. Medullary cancer originates from C cells and secretes calcitonin. Calcitonin assay helps distinguish between benign and malignant tumor. Anaplastic cancer is rare and aggressive.
Secondary thyroid neoplasms occur due to metastasis from distant primary sites. They tend to be poorly differentiated and are often fatal.
Most common cause of thyroid enlargement in children is Graves’ disease.
The most common cause of thyroid enlargement in adults is multinodular goiter.
Increase in serum TSH concentration increases release of thyroid hormones.
Decrease in serum TSH concentration decreases release of thyroid hormones.

Diagnosis: Graves' disease
Symptoms: Hypermetabolic state
Signs: Irregular heart beat, warm skin, nervousness, tremulous hands, muscle weakness, fatigue, weight loss, menstrual irregularity, osteoporosis, exophthalmous eyes, lid retraction, protruding tongue, hoarseness, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, sweating, fine hair, thinning hair, dry skin, constip",Multinodular goiter

Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?
Inferior deep cervical or Parotid or Retropharyngeal or Submental.","### Answer: Inferior deep cervical
### Explanation: Squamous cell carcinomas tend to spread along the basement membrane into the regional lymphatics. Lymphatic drainage from the floor of the mouth goes through the jugulodigastric node, then to the submental and submandibular nodes, followed by the upper deep cervical group, including the inferior deep cervical nodes. These nodes would therefore be evaluated first for evidence of metastases. Metastases to the retropharyngeal nodes occur less frequently but can cause airway obstruction. Parotidectomy is indicated if there is clinically palpable parotid enlargement. Neck dissection is performed when the primary tumor involves the neck region.
The other options listed are not involved early in the course of squamous cell carcinoma.

"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after he passed a renal calculus. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor or Na+ –Cl− symport inhibitor or Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitor or Osmotic diuretic.","### Answer: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
### Explanation: This patient has hypercalciuria due to excessive bone resorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism from nephrolithiasis. Increased intestinal absorption of calcium can be decreased by reducing acid secretion (proton pump inhibitors), which would decrease the amount of calcium reabsorbed in the duodenum. Calcitonin also reduces serum calcium levels but does not affect acid production. Acidification of the urine increases precipitation of calcium salts; therefore, carbonic anhydrase inhibition is used to reduce the concentration of H+ ion in the tubular fluid. Allopurinol is used to treat gout, not uric acid calculi. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that causes potassium loss and hypokalemia. Spironolactone is a competitive aldosterone antagonist that acts on the distal convoluted tubule to increase sodium and water excretion. Thiazides act on the early distal tubules to promote sodium chloride co-transport out of the tubule into the interstitium.
Diagnosis: Nephrolithiasis
Drug: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor

Key Concept
Calcific stones are formed when there is supersaturation of the urinary medium.
The main cause of this condition is hypercalcemia.
In order to prevent the formation of new stones it is necessary to correct the metabolic disorder responsible for their formation.
This therapy consists mainly in administering drugs capable of increasing the quantity of citrate in the bloodstream.
Citrate binds calcium forming insoluble complexes that cannot form stones.
These drugs are called ""antilithogenics"" or ""anticalciculogenics"".
They include:

Mannitol
Acetazolamide
Hydrochlohiazide
Amiloride
Potassium citrate
Calcium citrate
Aluminium hydroxide gel


Note:

Antilithogenics have been shown to be effective only in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria.
In other cases they are contraindicated because they could worsen the underlying disease.

"While you are on rounds at a local nursing facility, the nurse mentions that your patient, a 79-year-old woman, appears to be a ""poor eater."" She was admitted to the nursing facility 3 months ago from the hospital where she was treated for congestive heart failure. Her daughter had moved away from the area, and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently. Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin. Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. In your conversation with the patient, she says, ""No, I'm not depressed, I just don't have an appetite anymore. Nothing tastes good to me. I have a little bit of nausea most of the time."" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?
Chest x-ray or Complete blood count or Determination of serum albumin concentration or Determination of serum digoxin level.","### Answer: Complete blood count
### Explanation: This elderly woman has lost significant amounts of weight over the last several months despite adequate nutrition. Although her symptoms suggest possible depression, it would be unwise to jump immediately to this diagnosis when there might be other explanations for her symptom complex. A complete blood count would help determine if she were experiencing any type of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could account for her weight loss. If the CBC showed evidence of anemia, then iron supplementation could be tried to see if this improved her appetite. It also would be important to check for signs of malnutrition, including decreased skin turgor, muscle wasting, and edema. These findings would indicate poor fluid status and perhaps necessitate administration of additional fluids. Serum albumin levels can be low secondary to protein deficiency but also can be low due to liver disease. However, since the patient does not appear jaundiced, hepatic dysfunction seems unlikely. Similarly, although the patient complains of nausea, vomiting is not mentioned. Thus, determining the serum digoxin level would not likely provide useful information. Chest x-rays usually are ordered to evaluate patients who complain of chest pain or shortness of breath. Since these symptoms are absent here, a chest x-ray would not be indicated.
A comprehensive metabolic panel would allow assessment of electrolyte balance, renal function, glucose tolerance, and lipid profile. Such studies often are performed in older adults to identify underlying problems that contribute to their medical conditions. However, they are not needed initially in order to make decisions regarding treatment.

Her temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F). A few scattered inspiratory crackles are heard in the thorax. An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?
Amoxicillin or Cefaclor or Ciprofloxacin or Erythromycin.","### Answer: Amoxicillin
### Explanation: This patient has community acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy is indicated when there is evidence of consolidation on radiographs. Empirical antibiotics can be chosen based upon local patterns of resistance. In this case, amoxicillin would be an effective drug against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Cephalosporins have no advantage over penicillins in treating uncomplicated bacterial pneumonias. Quinolones are not recommended first line agents due to high rates of resistance among common pathogens. Macrolides are used only if other drugs cannot be administered. Azithromycin is preferred over erythromycin since it has better bioavailability, lower risk of QT prolongation, and fewer interactions with food and other medications.
Diagnosis: Community acquired pneumonia
Antimicrobial agent: Amoxicillin
Drug class: Penicillins
Mechanism of action: Inhibition of cell wall synthesis
Adverse effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, urticaria, angioedema
Contraindicated in patients allergic to penicillins
Drugs that interact with this medication: Probenecid decreases renal excretion of amoxicillin; allopurinol increases the risk of skin reactions from amoxicillin

"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a 2-hour history of confusion and agitation. He also has had fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2 days ago. His parents say he does not use illicit drugs. On arrival, he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations. His temperature is 40°C (104°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A lumbar puncture is performed. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following?
Facial nerve or Frontal sinus or Mastoid sinus or Olfactory nerve.","### Answer: Olfactory nerve
### Explanation: This patient has neurocysticercosis caused by the larval form of Taenia solium. Infection occurs when humans ingest eggs that have been passed in feces contaminated with T. solium cysticercus cellulosae. These eggs hatch in the small intestine and release oncospheres that penetrate the mucosal epithelial cells. The parasite then migrates through the lymphatic vessels to reach the brain via the olfactory nerves. Clinical manifestations include seizures, focal neurologic deficits, meningitis, hydrocephalus, and psychiatric symptoms. Treatment consists of albendazole plus corticosteroids.
The other choices are not portals of entry for the causative agent of neurocysticercosis.
Diagnosis: Neurocysticercosis

​
Highlight:
Neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of adult acquired epilepsy worldwide.
It is estimated that over 50 million people are affected by neurocysticercosis globally.
In endemic areas, it is estimated that up to 10% of the population is asymptomatically infected with neurocysticercosis.
Neurocysticercosis is the second leading cause of death due to parasitic infections after malaria.
Meningitis and hydrocephalus are rare complications of neurocysticercosis.
Treatment of choice for neurocysticercosis is praziquantel.

Albendazole is effective only against the encysted stage of T. solium.
Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy.
Albendazole is teratogenic and causes bone marrow suppression.
Albendazole is metabolized by the liver and excreted unchanged in urine.
Albendazole is highly protein bound.
Albendazole is administered orally once daily.
Albendazole is available as tablets containing 400 mg per pill.
Albendazole is used for treating neurocysticercosis in children older than 1 year old.
Albendazole is used for treating neurocysticercosis in patients who cannot tolerate praziquantel.
Albendazole is used for treating neurocysticercosis in patients with severe adverse reactions to praziquantel.
Albendazole is used for treating neurocysticercosis in patients with concomitant ascariasis.

"A 32-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of pain in his right shoulder for the past two weeks. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity. The cause of this patient's condition is most likely a somatic dysfunction of which of the following muscles?
anterior scalene or latissimus dorsi or pectoralis minor or supraspinatus.","### Answer: supraspinatus
### Explanation: Supraspinatus muscle originates from the greater tuberosity of the scapula and inserts into the lateral lip of the glenoid fossa. It acts primarily as an abductor of the arm but also assists in internal rotation of the arm. Injury to this muscle can result in impingement syndrome (subacromial bursitis). This occurs when the rotator cuff becomes pinched between the acromion process of the scapula and the head of the humerus. Pain results during active movements that require abduction and internal rotation of the arm.
The anterior scalene arises from the cervical vertebrae C3 through C7 and inses on the first rib. Its primary function is to elevate the first rib.
Latissimus dorsi arises from the lower six thoracic veebrae and insert onto the iliac crest. Its main action is extension and adduction of the arm.
Pectoralis minor arises from the second costal cartilage and inserts onto the coracoid process of the scapula. Its actions include medial rotation of the scapula and depression of the shoulder.
Subscapularis arises from the lesser spine of the scapula and inserts onto the lesser trochanter of the humerus. Its functions include medial rotation of the humerus and flexion of the arm.

"A 19-year-old male presents to the office for evaluation after he was hit from behind below the right knee while playing football. Gait analysis reveals a lack of fluid motion. Standing flexion test results are negative. Cruciate and collateral knee ligaments appear intact. Foot drop on the right is noted. The most likely diagnosis is
anteriorly deviated distal femur or plantar flexed cuboid or posteriorly deviated fibular head or unilateral sacral shear.","### Answer: anteriorly deviated distal femur
### Explanation: (a) Source: GAS 456; GA 80, 79, 78, 77, 76The patient has an apparent valgus deformity of his leg that causes him to walk with a limp. This condition can be caused by fracture of the proximal tibia, which would cause the lower end of the tibia to move forward relative to the upper end of the femur. Alternatively, it could result from dislocation of the patella, which would also produce a valgus deformity. In either case, there would not be any abnormalities of the cruciate or collateral ligaments. If the distal femoral epiphysis were displaced anteriorly, this would explain the foot drop.
(b) Plantar flexion of the cuboid would tend to increase the valgus deformity.
(c) Posterior subluxation of the fibula would have no effect upon gait.
(d) Unilateral sacroiliac shearing would not affect the alignment of the legs during walking.
(e) Subtalar joint fixation would not alter the alignment of the legs during walking.
(f) Tibial torsion would lead to varus deformity of the legs during walking.
(g) Fibular neck fracture would lead to external rotation of the leg during walking.
(h) Lateral meniscal tear would lead to internal rotation of the leg during walking.
(i) Medial meniscal tear would lead to external rotation of the leg during walking.
(j) Patellar dislocation would lead to lateral deviation of the leg during walking.
(k) Femoral shaft fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(l) Proximal tibial epiphyseal separation would lead to lateral deviation of the leg during walking.
(m) Distal femoral epiphyseal separation would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(n) Neck femur fracture would lead to lateral deviation of the leg during walking.
(o) Intercondylar femur fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(p) Condyles separated from the femoral neck would lead to lateral deviation of the leg during walking.
(q) Displaced intertrochanteric femur fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(r) Displaced subtrochanteric femur fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(s) Displaced supracondylar femur fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(t) Displaced condylar femur fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(u) Displaced diaphyseal femur fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(v) Displaced metaphyseal femur fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(w) Displaced osteochondral femur fracture would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(x) Displaced bone marrow edema would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(y) Displaced periosteum would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(z) Displaced muscle would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(aa) Displaced fat would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(bb) Displaced cartilage would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(cc) Displaced synovium would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.
(dd) Displaced capsule would lead to medial deviation of the leg during walking.

"A 45-year-old limousine driver comes to the office for an initial appointment because he would like you to fill out and sign a legal document at the request of his attorney. The patient states that he is filing a lawsuit against the limousine company that employs him because he developed post-traumatic stress disorder following a motor vehicle collision. He appears irritable and tense as he provides his history. He relays his symptoms by reading them aloud from a written list. At this time, which of the following is the most appropriate approach toward confirming the underlying diagnosis of this patient?
Administer amobarbital and then interview the patient or Ask the patient to provide a narrative with detailed description of the incident and of his symptoms or Interview the patient under hypnosis or Interview the patient while paying close attention to his willingness to make eye contact.","### Answer: Administer amobarbital and then interview the patient
### Explanation: This case describes malingering (i.e., feigning illness). Malingering can be difficult to distinguish from psychiatric disease; however, there are several clues suggesting malingering in this case. First, the patient has been seen previously by another physician who concluded that no organic basis existed for his complaints. Second, the patient’s presentation seems too perfect, i.e., he presents with all the classic features of PTSD. Third, the patient does not appear distressed despite having suffered a trauma. Fourth, when asked if he had any other health problems, he replied “no.” Fifth, he was able to recall details of the accident but could not remember how many times he went to the bathroom during the day. Sixth, he appeared very anxious throughout the examination. Seventh, he refused to allow you to examine his hands. Eighth, he did not have any physical findings consistent with PTSD. Ninth, he requested that you write a letter stating that he suffers from PTSD. Finally, he provided a long list of symptoms that were read verbatim from a piece of paper. In order to determine if the patient is malingering, it is necessary to administer a drug that suppresses conscious awareness of memory (amobarbital), followed by a careful reinterview of the patient. If the patient admits to faking his symptoms after being questioned again, then he probably is malingering. However, if the patient denies ever having experienced these symptoms even though they are present on the chart, then he probably has a true psychiatric condition.
Option B: While asking the patient to provide a narrative with detailed descriptions of the incident and of his symptoms might help identify certain characteristics of PTSD, it cannot differentiate between PTSD caused by a real event versus PTSD due to malingering.
Option C: Hypnotizing patients is generally considered unethical and therefore contraindicated. It also cannot differentiate between PTSD caused by a real event versus PTSD due to malingering.
Option D: Paying close attention to the patient’s willingness to make eye contact is important in detecting deception, but it cannot differentiate between PTSD caused by a real event versus PTSD due to malingering.
Key concept: Amobarbital administration followed by a careful reinterview of the patient is used to determine if the patient is malingering.

"A 5-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-week history of fever and increasingly severe abdominal discomfort. At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities?
Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells or Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface or Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms or Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms.","### Answer: Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms
### Explanation: Chronic granulomatous disease results from mutations that affect the NADPH oxidase complex, leading to decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are necessary for killing intracellular bacteria. Neutrophil migration into tissues occurs normally; however, these patients have recurrent skin infections despite normal numbers of circulating neutrophils. Leukocyte adhesion molecules are not affected. Diagnosis: Chronic granulomatous disease

• Chediak-Higashi syndrome
Defective lysosome trafficking → Defective phagolysosome formation
• CGD
NADPH oxidase deficiency → Decreased ROS production
• Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
Defective actin polymerization → Impaired chemotaxis
• Bruton agammaglobulinemia

Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are performed, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. The technician most likely used which of the following laboratory procedures on this patient's blood?
Northern blotting or Polymerase chain reaction or Reverse transcription or Southern blotting.","### Answer: Polymerase chain reaction
### Explanation: PCR amplifies small segments of double-stranded DNA using primers that flank the region of interest. This technique can be used to detect viruses, genes, or other sequences within cells. Northern blots use RNA probes; reverse transcriptases generate complementary DNA strands from RNA templates; and southern blots use single-stranded DNA probes.

Key Concept

The process of increasing the number of copies of a particular sequence of DNA through multiple rounds of replication.

Principle & Mechanism

PCR uses two primers designed to hybridize to opposite strands of a target DNA sequence. These primers bind to the target DNA and initiate synthesis of new DNA strands by Taq polymerase. Each cycle consists of denaturation, annealing, and extension steps. Denaturation separates the DNA into its component strands. Annealing causes the primers to attach to each strand. Extension involves the addition of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dUTP), catalyzed by Taq polymerase. At the end of each cycle, the products serve as templates for the next round of amplification.

Clinical Focus: Diagnostic Testing

PCR has revolutionized molecular diagnostics because it allows detection of minute amounts of DNA in clinical samples. It is particularly useful when applied to infectious diseases caused by organisms whose numbers are very low in body fluids. For example, PCR can identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum specimens. In cancer diagnosis, PCR can detect circulating tumor cells in peripheral venous blood. PCR also plays a critical role in prenatal testing, where it can detect fetal chromosomal abnormalities.

Contraindications

There are no contraindications to performing PCR. However, false positives can occur if contaminants enter the sample during collection or processing. False negatives can result from insufficient quantities of template DNA.

Special Considerations

PCR requires special equipment, including thermal cyclers, pipettes, and centrifuges. Thermal cyclers heat and cool reagents rapidly. Pipettes allow precise dispensing of tiny volumes of fluid. Centrifuges separate cell components based on density.

Drugs That May Be Used

No drugs are required before starting PCR.

Precautions

No precautions are necessary before beginning PCR.

Complications

False positive results can occur due to contamination. False negative results can occur if there are insufficient quantities of DNA.

Patient Education

Explain that PCR is a test that helps diagnose certain conditions by identifying specific pieces of DNA. Explain that the procedure does not require any medication. Emphasize that patients must follow instructions carefully to avoid errors in collecting and handling their bodily fluids.

Radiologic Evaluation

PCR does not involve imaging techniques.

Therapeutic Procedures

PCR does not have therapeutic applications.

Histology

PCR cannot provide histological information.

Other Imaging Techniques

PCR does not rely on radiographic images.

Related Procedures

Western blot analysis, Southern blot analysis, northern blot analysis, ELISAs, flow cytometry, microarray analysis, gene expression profiling.

"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his babysitter because of a 30-minute history of respiratory distress. The babysitter reports that she is 15 years old and has cared for the patient on numerous occasions during the past year. The child's mother, who is a single parent, is currently out of town for business but will return later tonight. The babysitter says, ""He has had a runny nose since I started babysitting yesterday, but this afternoon he awoke from a nap with a barking sound and he was breathing real heavy."" She does not know the child's prior health history, nor does she know if the boy takes any medications on a regular basis. The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap. He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver. Vital signs are temperature 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 28/min and labored, and blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor. Neck is supple, tympanic membranes are normal, and there is a profuse nasal discharge. Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities. Auscultation of the chest discloses equal air entry on both sides and no crackles. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment with 40% oxygen via venturi mask and intravenous fluids is initiated. Despite continued supplemental oxygen and hydration, the child remains tachypneic and stridorous at rest. Oxygen saturation is now 93%. In addition to administering racemic epinephrine by nebulizer, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Intravenous aminophylline therapy or Intravenous antibiotic therapy or Intubation or Oral dexamethasone therapy.","### Answer: Intubation
### Explanation: This child has acute severe asthma. Although it is difficult to determine how much time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and presentation to the hospital, the fact that the child developed respiratory distress while sleeping suggests that the attack began several hours earlier. Because the child is still having difficulty breathing despite receiving oxygen and IV fluid resuscitation, endotracheal intubation is indicated. Racemic epinephrine is used when patients have mild to moderate disease; however, these dosages are unlikely to be effective once the child becomes hypoxic. Antibiotics would only be necessary if pneumonia were suspected, which is highly unlikely based upon the physical findings. Aminophylline is useful in chronic cases of bronchial asthma, but its use is contraindicated in acute attacks. Dexamethasone can be used in children with persistent asthmatic conditions, but it is not recommended for treatment of acute episodes.
Diagnosis: Asthma
Laboratory diagnosis: None
Treatment: Endotracheal intubation, oxygen administration, IV fluid resuscitation
Drugs associated with this condition: Epinephrine, albuterol, ipratropium, corticosteroids
Other diagnostic considerations: Foreign body aspiration

Asthma

It is defined as recurrent episodic syndrome characterized by wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness and cough.
The pathogenesis involves inflammation of the airways leading to increased responsiveness of tracheobronchial tree to various stimuli.
There is hyperresponsiveness of airway smooth muscle due to release of mediators like histamine, leukotrienes etc.
Increased production of mucus results in airflow obstruction.

"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting; he also has had decreased appetite during this period. The pain was initially on the right but now has become generalized. His temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 143/83 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness. There are no palpable masses. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a perforated appendix. Examination of peritoneal fluid from this patient will most likely show which of the following organisms?
Candida albicans or Citrobacter freundii or Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus.","### Answer: Candida albicans
### Explanation: Perforated appendicitis can lead to secondary bacteremia caused by anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species. In addition, fungi that colonize the GI tract, particularly Candida albicans, can cause septic shock. C. freundii causes acute cholecystitis. E. coli causes urinary tract infections. S. aureus causes wound infection.

"A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements. She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin or Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or Pelvic ultrasonography or CT scan of the abdomen with contrast.","### Answer: Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin
### Explanation: This patient presents with acute colitis characterized by diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. Although she was treated with antibiotics, which could have caused this condition, it is unlikely that the duration of illness would be only 1 week if the cause were an iatrogenic event. In addition, the presence of chronic constipation suggests that the current problem is unrelated to the previous surgery. Diagnosis can usually be made based on clinical presentation alone; however, testing of the stool for C difficile toxins is recommended when the diagnosis is uncertain. If positive, treatment consists of discontinuation of offending agents and administration of vancomycin. Occasionally, endoscopy may reveal pseudomembranes overlying inflamed mucosa.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography is used primarily to evaluate biliary obstruction and gallstones. It is also useful in patients who present with jaundice and right upper quadrant pain. Ultrasound is often sufficient to identify gallstones and other causes of obstructive jaundice. CT scanning is indicated when ultrasound does not provide adequate information.
Diagnostic paracentesis is performed in patients with ascites due to cirrhosis or neoplastic disease.
A colonoscopy is typically done after a complete workup of the patient’s GI tract to exclude any lesions within the colon.
An MRI of the spine is ordered when a patient complains of back pain and weakness in his legs.
The FDG PET scan is ordered when a patient has a high suspicion of cancer.
The lipid profile is part of the basic laboratory tests.
The ECG is ordered when a patient has symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy is performed when a patient has dyspepsia and weight loss.
The thyroid function tests are ordered when a patient has fatigue and cold intolerance.
The prostate specific antigen level is elevated in men with prostatic carcinoma.
The cytology of the cervix is obtained during a routine Pap smear.
The biopsy of the skin nodule is taken when a patient has a mole changing its appearance.
The lumbar puncture is performed when a patient has signs and symptoms of central nervous system involvement.
The bronchoscopy is performed when a patient has persistent cough and sputum production.
The transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy is performed when a man has a family history of prostate cancer.
The breast imaging report and data system (BIRADS) score is assigned to women who undergo screening mammography.
The",CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
"A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of vaginal bleeding for 2 to 5 days every 2 weeks. The flow varies from light to heavy with passage of clots. Menses previously occurred at regular 25- to 29-day intervals and lasted for 5 days with normal flow. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. Her mother died of colon cancer, and her maternal grandmother died of breast cancer. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 77 kg (170 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 36.6°C (97.8°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. The uterus is normal sized. The ovaries cannot be palpated. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Progesterone challenge test or Colposcopy or Cystoscopy or Endometrial biopsy.","### Answer: Progesterone challenge test
### Explanation: This patient presents with menorrhagia that started after menopause. Menorrhagia can occur due to endometrial hyperplasia secondary to estrogen excess. Estrogens stimulate proliferative changes in the endometrium; however, these effects are counterbalanced by progestins, which induce secretory changes. In postmenopausal women who have undergone surgical removal of their ovaries, there is decreased production of both estradiol and progesterone. Thus, unopposed estrogen exposure results in endometrial hyperplasia and irregular menses. The risk of developing endometrial carcinoma increases if the duration of unopposed estrogen exposure exceeds 2 years. To confirm this diagnosis, a progesterone challenge test can be performed. If the endometrium responds normally to exogenous administration of progesterones, then it indicates an intact feedback loop between estrogen and progesterone receptors. It also confirms that the cause of the symptomatic irregularity is not related to any other pathology. Other causes of irregular menses include thyroid dysfunction, polycystic ovary syndrome, and pregnancy. Colposcopy would be indicated if cervical lesions were present. Cystoscopy would be used to evaluate urinary tract problems. Endometrial biopsy could be done but only when clinically suspected.
Diagnosis: Postmenopausal bleeding
Treatment: Oral contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone

​",Endometrial biopsy
"A 13-year-old girl is brought to the office for a health maintenance visit. She was diagnosed with Turner syndrome in infancy during a work-up for coarctation of the aorta. During today's visit, her mother reports that the girl has been talking about babies. You have been the patient's physician for the past 6 years and know she is prepubescent. It is most appropriate to counsel the patient that if she wishes to have a family she will need to do which of the following?
Adopt or Have amniocentesis if she gets pregnant or Have an operation or Receive genetic counseling.","### Answer: Receive genetic counseling
### Explanation: This young woman cannot bear children because of her chromosomal abnormality. However, it would be premature to discuss this issue until she reaches puberty. At that time, you can offer her information on reproductive options (e.g., adoption). If she becomes sexually active before then, you could advise her to use contraception.
Diagnosis: Turner syndrome
Laboratory value: Low serum estradiol level
Drug: Estrogen replacement therapy
Disease: Osteoporosis
Procedure: Coicosteroid injection
Advice: Counsel regarding menstruation
Concept: Menarche occurs after breast development; thus, any female who develops breasts should expect menses within several years unless there is an underlying cause for delayed maturation.

"A 77-year-old man is brought to the physician because of a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty and weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. He is alert. His pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose concentration is 162 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Carotid duplex ultrasonography or CT scan of the head or EEG or Lumbar puncture.","### Answer: Carotid duplex ultrasonography
### Explanation: This patient has new focal neurologic deficits that have developed over several hours. Although he also has evidence of hemiparesis, his presentation suggests an embolic stroke rather than a hematogenous stroke. In addition, there is a high risk of recurrent stroke if carotid artery disease is present. Therefore, carotid duplex ultrasound would be indicated here. If this study were abnormal, then anticoagulation could be considered.
The other choices are not indicated in patients who have had a recent stroke.
Diagnosis: Embolic stroke
Treatment: Anticoagulation
Drug therapy: Aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin
Key concept: Patients with acute stroke require prompt evaluation and treatment; however, anticoagulants are contraindicated within the first few days after stroke.
Antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) can be used immediately after stroke. Warfarin can be started once the platelets have returned to normal levels.

"A 16-year-old high school student, whose prenatal course you have managed, delivers a 3256-g (7-lb 3-oz) baby girl during the night with the assistance of your associate. On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Today blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, she is afebrile, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management?
Begin oral methyldopa or Institute fundal massage or Order daily sitz baths or Provide education for well-baby care.","### Answer: Begin oral methyldopa
### Explanation: Postpartum hypertension can occur from preeclampsia, eclampsia, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or idiopathic postpartum hypertension. In this case, it was likely due to severe preeclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome. Methyldopa is effective in controlling hypeensive symptoms but does not prevent end organ damage. It is usually started after delivery because of its association with neonatal sedation. Oral contraceptives are also used to treat postpaum hypertension; however, they carry risks associated with their use including thromboembolism.
The patient’s vital signs are within normal limits today. Although there is still some swelling noted on examination, the findings are consistent with a normal recovery. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic shock requiring further intervention. Therefore, the best initial step would be to begin oral methyldopa therapy.
Fundal massage is useful when there has been excessive bleeding into the uterus. This patient did not experience any significant bleeding.
Daily sitz baths are recommended if there were complications related to vaginal discharge or tearing. However, these are not indicated here.
Education regarding breastfeeding and well-baby care is essential for all new mothers.
Adequate hydration is necessary to help control postpaum hypertension.
Magnesium sulfate is administered intravenously to women who develop seizures secondary to preeclampsia.

"A previously healthy 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion. She plays field hockey and has noticed she coughs when running up and down the field. The cough is nonproductive and resolves with rest. She has not had chest pain or palpitations. She takes no medications and does not smoke. Her sister has asthma. The patient appears well. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Asthma or Chronic bronchitis or Gastroesophageal reflux disease or Postnasal drip syndrome.","### Answer: Asthma
### Explanation: This young woman has episodic symptoms that improve with rest. These findings suggest the diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma (EIA). EIA can be primary or secondary; this patient has normal spirometric values between attacks but reduced lung function during an attack. In contrast, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would have a lower FEV1 and FEV1 :FVC ratio. Postnasal drainage from allergies could cause rhinitis and sinusitis, which might lead to mucosal edema and obstruction of large airways, but it usually causes only intermittent wheezing. Cigarette smoking predisposes patients to emphysema, which presents with a low FEV1 and FEV1 :FVC ratio. Gastroesophageal reflux disease can present with cough and aspiration pneumonia, but these features alone are insufficient to establish the diagnosis.

"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. One week ago, she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant. Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?
Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 or P-selectin or Stromelysin or Vascular endothelial growth factor.","### Answer: Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1
### Explanation: Granulation tissue consists of proliferating fibroblasts and vascular channels that form during healing processes. These cells express glycosylated proteins called glycoproteins, including CD34 (a marker of hematopoietic stem cells), CD106 (a marker of lymphocytes), and glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD35). Increased expression of these glycoproteins allows leukocyte migration into the area of injury. P-selectin is expressed on platelets and endothelium; it mediates rolling of neutrophils out of blood vessels and onto the surface of inflamed areas. Stromelysin is an enzyme secreted from macrophages that breaks down ECM components. Vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates angiogenesis. Integrins allow leukocytes to bind to each other and to ECM components.

""The process of repairing damaged skin involves the activation of many different types of cells, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. All of these cells must be able to migrate through the extracellular matrix (ECM) to reach their destination."" - Robbins Basic Pathology, 9th edition, page 85.

"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22– 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?
The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD or The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD or The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration or The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation.","### Answer: The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD
### Explanation: This young woman is likely a carrier of the gene responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), since she has an affected male sibling and an affected paternal uncle. Carriers have no clinical symptoms but can transmit the mutant allele to their offspring. In females who carry the mutated gene, there is a 50% chance that each son will be affected and a 50% chance that each daughter will also be carriers. Males who inherit only one copy of the mutated gene from their mothers are unaffected but become carriers like their mothers. Female carriers typically have elevated levels of creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) due to increased muscle breakdown. If both parents are carriers, then all children have a 25% chance of being affected, two thirds of daughters will be carriers, and one third of sons will be carriers. Random X inactivation does not affect the transmission pattern of autosomal recessive diseases.
Diagnosis: Duchenne muscular dystrophy
",The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation
"A 3-year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48 hours after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been ""squatters"" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?
Call her previous physician to obtain more history or Order a chest x-ray or Order a test for HIV antibody or Repeat the PPD skin test.","### Answer: Call her previous physician to obtain more history
### Explanation: This child probably acquired tuberculosis from an infected parent who did not seek treatment because of lack of access to healthcare. It would be unwise to repeat the PPD skin test until it can be determined if there is active disease present. If the patient does have active TB, then the next step would be to determine how far along the disease process is before starting therapy. In addition, the family needs to receive education on proper handwashing techniques and other measures to prevent transmission of TB.
The mother’s negative reaction to the positive result suggests that she may need counseling regarding the importance of seeking medical attention when needed.
Ordering a chest x- ray could help confirm the diagnosis, but it also exposes the child to radiation.
HIV testing is indicated only if the person is symptomatic.
A Mantoux test is used to detect hypersensitivity reactions to purified protein derivative (PPD).
It is performed intradermal route using a syringe containing 0.1 ml of PPD RCA (tuberculin), which contains purified proteins derived from M. tuberculosis bacteria grown in rabbits.
The standard size of the test is 6mm of diameter.
If the reading is less than 9mm after 72hours, it is considered a negative test.
If the reading is greater than 10mm after 72hours, it is considered a positive test.
Interpretation of results:
Negative: No immune response against M. tuberculosis.
Positive: Immune response against M. tuberculosis.
Indeterminate: Not possible to interpret due to insufficient amount of antigen deposited under the skin.
Incorrect interpretation of a positive test may occur in patients suffering from sarcoidosis, leprosy, viral hepatitis, lymphoma, silicosis, histoplasmosis, and other granulomatous diseases.

"A 65-year-old female is admitted to the hospital after experiencing aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis. She subsequently develops urinary incontinence. There is no evidence of urinary tract infection and no prior history of urinary pathology. The most likely diagnosis is
autonomic neurogenic bladderv or motor paralytic bladder or reflex neurogenic bladder or uninhibited neurogenic bladder.","### Answer: autonomic neurogenic bladderv
### Explanation: Autonomic dysfunction can lead to detrusor overactivity (uninhibited neurogenic bladder), which results in urge incontinence. This condition occurs when there is loss of central micturition center control of the detrusor muscle due to damage to the spinal cord above S2 or below S4. In this case, the patient has suffered an infarct that damaged her brain stem, resulting in a lesion of the pontine micturition center. Pontine lesions result in flaccid bladders because they interrupt sympathetic innervation to the detrusor muscle. Detrusor hyperreflexia is seen in patients who have sustained a thoracolumbar injury.

"A 35-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3-day history of severe right back pain. She has not had any fever, chills, or weight loss. She has no history of major medical illness. Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. When told that her examination is normal, the patient becomes tearful and demands an MRI of her back because her mother just died from breast cancer metastatic to bone and she fears that she may also have cancer. The patient already contacted her insurance company, who told her that if she has neurologic abnormalities an MRI may be covered by her plan. The patient asks the physician to order the MRI indicating that she has neurologic findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?
Advise the patient to change insurance companies as soon as she is able so that she can receive more comprehensive medical care or Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings or Immediately inform the patient's insurance company about what the patient has asked the physician to do or Order the MRI as the patient requests.","### Answer: Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings
### Explanation: This patient is seeking reassurance through unnecessary testing. It would be unethical to falsify the record to obtain this test. If the patient were truly concerned about having cancer, then she could undergo screening tests recommended by the American Cancer Society (ACS). However, since there is no family history of cancer, these tests are not indicated. In addition, ordering an MRI would only increase the cost of healthcare.
The other choices listed above are incorrect. For example, advising the patient to change insurance companies would not address the immediate problem; nor would immediately informing the patient’s insurance company help resolve the situation.
Ordering the MRI as requested by the patient would be considered fraudulent activity on the part of the physician.

"A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?
Intramural (pre-prostatic) or Membranous or Prostatic or Spongy.","### Answer: Intramural (pre-prostatic)
### Explanation: The pre-prostatic portion of the urethra lies within the prostate gland itself and therefore is at highest risk for injury during blunt trauma to the anterior abdominal wall. This region of the urethra is also known as intramural because it runs through the middle of the prostate gland. The membranous urethra is located between the deep dorsal vein and the inferior vesical artery; thus, it is not likely to be injured from direct blows to the anterior abdomen. The spongy urethra is located on the posterior surface of the prostate gland and is unlikely to be damaged from an anterior impact. The bulbar urethra passes through the sphincter urethrae muscle and is protected by its proximity to the symphysis pubis. The prostatic urethra courses through the prostate gland and is relatively well protected from external forces.

""Because of its location, the membranous urethra is rarely involved in injuries caused by blunt trauma."" - Gray’s Basic Anatomy By Richard Drake, A. Wayne Vogl, Adam W. M. Mitchell
""The spongy urethra is located posterolaterally and is not susceptible to injury from blunt trauma."" - Snell’s Anatomy

"A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6 months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is
collateral estoppel or proximate cause or res ipsa loquitur or respondeat superior.","### Answer: res ipsa loquitur
### Explanation: Res ipsa loquitur means ""the thing speaks for itself."" It refers to cases where it can be inferred from the circumstances that which would otherwise require proof (i.e., medical negligence). This doctrine applies when the following conditions exist: (1) an injury occurred; (2) the doctor had exclusive control over the instrumentality causing the injury; and (3) the accident would not ordinarily occur if proper care were exercised.
Collateral estoppel is used when a party who has already lost once on a point of law tries again because he believes that his lawyer made a mistake during the first trial. For example, suppose a man sued another man for slander and lost. Later, he tried to sue the same person for libel but failed because the court ruled that since he had previously lost the case involving slander, he cannot bring up the issue of defamation again.
Proximate cause is defined as the event that leads directly to harm. If a physician’s actions lead to a disease process, then they constitute the proximate cause of the resulting condition.
Respondeat superior means “let the master answer.” It is applied when an agent commits a tort while acting within the scope of employment.
Contributory negligence occurs when both parties contribute to the occurrence of the injuries.
Strict liability is a theory of recovery based upon the idea that certain activities carry inherent risks to others.

"A 35-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of sarcoidosis. His only new complaint is pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing. He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months. Vital signs now are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 78/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is thin and is in no acute distress. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered bilateral basilar crackles. There is mild left hip pain present with both active and passive range of motion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact. Neurologic examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Avascular necrosis of the femoral head or Herniated nucleus pulposus or Narrowing of the hip joint or Osteoporosis.","### Answer: Avascular necrosis of the femoral head
### Explanation: This patient has avascular necrosis of the femoral head secondary to long-term use of steroids. Steroids can lead to osteonecrosis of bones because they interfere with calcium metabolism. In addition, patients on chronic corticosteroids have an increased risk of developing peptic ulcers, cataracts, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and psychoses. Peptic ulcer disease is usually treated with antacids; however, if there is bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, surgical treatment must be considered. Cataract formation occurs after several years of exposure to high dosages of glucocorticoids. Diabetes mellitus develops when the adrenal cortex produces sufficient amounts of coisol to counterbalance the effects of insulin. Hypertension results from sodium retention caused by mineralocorticoid action. Psychotic reactions occur rarely but require immediate withdrawal of glucocorticoids.
The other choices are not associated with glucocorticoid administration.

"A 67-year-old man with Parkinson disease is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia. The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?
Obtain CT scan of the chest or Obtain a swallowing evaluation or Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or Prescribe fludrocortisone.","### Answer: Obtain a swallowing evaluation
### Explanation: This elderly male presents with symptoms consistent with parkinsonism and pneumonia. Although it is difficult to determine if this patient would benefit from PEG placement, it is clear that he needs to be evaluated before being sent home. In addition to obtaining an updated neurological examination, a swallowing assessment is indicated because of the risk of aspiration associated with dysphagia. Swallowing difficulties can lead to malnutrition and dehydration, both of which exacerbate parkinsonian features. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances must be corrected before patients are allowed to leave the hospital. Levodopa dosage adjustments are often necessary after acute illnesses, especially pneumonia. However, these changes should only occur once the patient is medically stable.
A CT scan of the chest is usually obtained to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia and to exclude other causes of fever. It does not provide information regarding the need for PEG placement.
The use of fludrocortisone is controversial and generally reserved for patients with autonomic failure due to advanced cardiac disease. There is little evidence supporting its use in patients with parkinsonism alone.
Placement of a nasogastric feeding tube is sometimes used while awaiting results of a swallowing study. If the test demonstrates difficulty with swallowing, then a PEG tube could be placed.
Dopamine agonists have been shown to improve motor function in patients with parkinsonism. These agents are useful adjunctive medications, but they cannot replace levodopa.
Levodopa absorption is delayed by food ingestion. Therefore, meals should be spaced out throughout the day rather than eaten all at once.
Motor fluctuations are characterized by periods of worsening of parkinsonian symptoms lasting up to several hours followed by improvement. They tend to become worse over time.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare complication of antipsychotic drug administration. It is characterized by muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, extrapyramidal side effects, and mental status changes.
Perioral numbness occurs in some patients receiving long-term levodopa therapy.
Rigidity refers to resistance to passive movement. Cogwheel rigidity is caused by involuntary contractions of large groups of skeletal muscles.
Tremor is defined as an irregular oscillatory motion of a part of the body. Resting tremor is seen in patients with essential tremor. Postural tremor is present in patients with parkinsonism.

"A 64-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of increasing shortness of breath, sore throat, and a cough productive of a small amount of white phlegm. Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following?
Mesothelioma or Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast or Multiple endocrine neoplasia or Non-small cell lung carcinoma.","### Answer: Small cell lung carcinoma
### Explanation: This patient has metastases from a primary cancer that was not detected on initial imaging studies. The presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy suggests an extranodal tumor, since enlarged lymph nodes would typically drain into the mediastinum through the thoracic duct. In addition, the finding of a solitary pulmonary nodule with multiple satellite lesions is characteristic of small cell lung carcinoma. These findings suggest a diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma. Mesotheliomas tend to have pleural involvement rather than intrathoracic masses. Breast cancers usually present as palpable masses in the breast; they rarely spread to the lung. MEN I is characterized by pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and hyperparathyroidism. Squamous cell carcinomas are common but less aggressive than small cell carcinomas.

"A 46-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, comes to the office because of a 2-week history of black discharge from her right nipple. The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2 months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity, palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, noted at her most recent annual examination. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. BMI is 30 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses. There is scant, black discharge from the right nipple. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Ductography or Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue or Repeat mammography or Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast.","### Answer: Ductography
### Explanation: This patient has duct ectasia (also known as periductal mastitis), which can be associated with fibrocystic disease, pregnancy, obesity, diabetes, smoking, and alcohol use. It presents with chronic inflammation of the lactiferous duct system that leads to dilatation, stasis, and obstruction. In this setting, there is an increase in bacterial colonization, leading to purulent discharge through the affected duct. Treatment includes antibiotics directed against Staphylococcus aureus and topical application of warm compresses. If symptoms persist despite treatment, surgery may be indicated. Ductography involves injection of contrast material into the suspected duct under fluoroscopic guidance; it is useful in identifying the site of obstruction and planning operative therapy. Mammography would not show any abnormalities unless there was a mass lesion within the breast parenchyma. Ultrasound could demonstrate dilated ducts if they were large enough to be seen on ultrasound.

Key Concept:
Periductal mastitis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the lactiferous duct system that leads to dilatation, stasis, and obstruction.
In this setting, there is an increase in bacterial colonization, leading to purulent discharge through the affected duct.
Treatment includes antibiotics directed against S.aureus and topical application of warm compresses.
If symptoms persist despite treatment, surgery may be indicated.
Ductography involves injection of contrast material into the suspected duct under fluoroscopic guidance; it is useful in identifying the site of obstruction and planning operative therapy.
Mammography would not show any abnormalities unless there was a mass lesion within the breast parenchyma.
Ultrasound could demonstrate dilated ducts if they were large enough to be seen on ultrasound.
The most common cause of bloody nipple discharge is trauma to the nipple.
Other causes include papilloma, intraductal carcinoma, and duct ectasia.

"A 37-year-old woman with AIDS comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressive diarrhea and a 1.8- kg (4-lb) weight loss. During the past week, she has had six large watery stools daily. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA. She also flies to Asia at least once monthly. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 112/64 mm Hg. The abdomen is scaphoid. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3 (Normal≥500). Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?
Cryptosporidium parvum or Cytomegalovirus or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex or Salmonella enteritidis.","### Answer: Cryptosporidium parvum
### Explanation: This patient has acquired an intestinal protozoan infection while traveling abroad. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic identification of oocysts in freshly voided stool. Treatment consists of nitazoxanide.
Mycobacteria cause chronic diarrhea that can be associated with weight loss but not acute diarrhea.
Salmonella causes bloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain; it does not infect the GI tract of immunocompromised patients.
Isospora belli causes self-limited diarrhea in healthy individuals but severe disease in those who are immunocompromised.
Giardia lamblia causes malabsorption rather than secretory diarrhea.
Toxoplasma gondii causes encephalitis in immunocompromised persons.
Diagnoses other than cryptosporidiosis require additional testing, including endoscopy, biopsies, and cultures.
The incubation period for cryptosporidiosis ranges from 2–10 days after exposure.
Infectious agents causing diarrhea in immunocompromised hosts include cytomegalovirus, Isospora belli, Giardia lamblia, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Microsporidia spp., and mycobacterial species.
Most common symptoms of cryptosporidiosis include profuse nonbloody diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and malaise.
Patients with AIDS have a higher risk of developing severe illness due to cryptosporidiosis compared to otherwise healthy individuals.
Treatment options for cryptosporidiosis include nitazoxanide, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, paromomycin, pentamidine, and azithromycin.
Nitazoxanide is effective against both Cryptosporidium and cyclosporiasis.
Paromomycin is used only when there is documented resistance to all other drugs.
Pentamidine is administered intramuscularly every 2 weeks. Azithromycin is administered orally twice daily for 1 week.
Acyclovir is used primarily for herpes simplex virus infections.
Dapsone is used primarily for pneumocystosis.
Metronidazole is used primarily for amebiasis.
Erythromycin is used primarily for Legionnaires’ disease.
Clindamycin is used primarily for babesiosis.
Amantadine is used primarily for influenza A virus infection.

"A healthy 22-year-old man participates in a study of glucose metabolism. At the beginning of the study, his serum glucose concentration is within the reference range. He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?
Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal or Glucose release from skeletal muscle or Glycogenolysis in the liver or Increased leptin release from adipose tissues.","### Answer: Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal
### Explanation: Whenever there is excessive intake of dietary sugar, it gets stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles. But if the amount of sugar consumed exceeds the capacity to store it, it goes into storage organs like adipose tissue. This process is called lipogenesis. Lipogenesis occurs when there is sufficient availability of insulin (i.e., blood glucose level is high). Insulin stimulates the activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase which conves pyruvate to malonyl CoA. Malonyl CoA is used up in the synthesis of fatty acid. So, option B is ruled out. Option D states that increased leptin release from adipose tissues causes satiety. Leptin acts on hypothalamus to decrease appetite. It does not have any effect on blood glucose levels.
Option C states that glycogenolysis in the liver leads to increase in blood glucose levels. However, glycogenolysis can occur only after depletion of glycogen stores. Since the person has eaten enough to replenish his glycogen stores, he cannot undergo glycogenolysis.
Option E states that decreased leptin secretion from adipocytes increases hunger. Leptin acts on hypothalamus to decrease appetite. It does not have any effect on blood glucose levels.
Thus, among all options, continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal is the best answer because it explains how the body continues to absorb nutrients even during fasting.
Key Concept: 
Liver glycogen stores serve as a reservoir of readily available energy. Liver cells take up glucose from the bloodstream via GLUT2 transporters and convert it to glycogen.

"A previously healthy 22-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20 minutes after they observed her having a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Bacterial meningitis or Dextromethorphan intoxication or Herpes simplex encephalitis or HIV encephalopathy.","### Answer: Bacterial meningitis
### Explanation: This patient has meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pneumococcal meningitis can be associated with septicemia, otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, endocarditis, arthritis, pericarditis, choroiditis, and urethritis. It occurs predominantly in children younger than 5 years and older adults. Infection usually begins extracranially but spreads hematogenously through the bloodstream. Clinical manifestations include fever, headache, vomiting, irritability, photophobia, neck stiffness, altered sensorium, and focal neurological signs. Meningism is present only rarely. Lumbar puncture findings show pleocytosis with lymphocytopenia and increased polymorphonuclear cells, elevated protein levels, and decreased glucose concentrations. Treatment includes antibiotics directed against S. pneumoniae.
Dextromethorphan intoxication does not cause these symptoms.
Herpes simplex encephalitis presents with fever, headache, confusion, and seizures. There would also be vesicular lesions on the skin that have not been described.
HIV encephalopathy typically develops over months to years and causes cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, and motor dysfunction.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysm results in sudden loss of consciousness followed by coma.
Toxic shock syndrome is characterized by high fever, hypotension, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea, and desquamation of the palms and soles.
Diagnosis: Acute bacterial meningitis
Treatment: Antimicrobial therapy

"A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?
Granulosa tumor or Ovarian carcinoid or Sertoli-Leydig tumor or Teratoma.","### Answer: Granulosa tumor
### Explanation: This patient has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by hyperandrogenism, irregular menses, obesity, hirsutism, infertility, and insulin resistance. PCOS accounts for approximately half of all cases of female hypogonadotropic hypoestrogenemia. It occurs when there is an increase in LH secretion from the pituitary gland that stimulates follicular development but does not lead to ovulation. Follicles become cystic and eventually undergo atresia. Hyperinsulinemia can be associated with PCOS; it leads to increased production of estrogens through peripheral conversion of androgens. Increased levels of circulating androgens cause virilization. Theca lutein cells produce excessive amounts of adrenocorticoids, leading to increased production of estradiol. Theca leydig cells secrete high levels of androgens, including testosterone. These factors contribute to endometrial proliferation and neoplasia. Theca cell tumors include granulosa and theca lutein cell tumors. Granulosa cell tumors account for 9% of epithelial ovarian cancer and have a better prognosis compared to other types of ovarian cancer. They typically present with symptoms related to estrogen overproduction, including menorrhagia, abdominal pain, and precocious puberty. Histologically, they consist of large cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and central nuclei. Theca lutein cell tumors are rare and usually occur during pregnancy. They are composed of large cells with lipid vacuoles and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Treatment involves surgery followed by chemotherapy if necessary.
Ovarian carcinoid tumors are uncommon and arise from Kulchitsky cells. They are benign lesions that rarely metastasize. They are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during laparotomy. Histology reveals nests of uniform round cells with scant cytoplasm and small nuclei.
Sertoli-Leydig tumors are the second most common type of sex cord stromal tumor after granulose cell tumors. They originate from Leydig cells and are composed of large cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei. They are also known as interstitial cell tumors. They are generally well differentiated and have a favorable outcome.
A teratoma is a mixed germ cell tumor that contains tissues derived from each of the three primary embryonic layers. Mature teratomas are composed of recognizable structures such as teeth, bones, cartilage, thyroid, and fatty tissue. Immunohistochemistry helps identify specific components. Unlike immature teratomas, mature teratomas tend to be encapsulated and less aggressive.

"A 77-year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of a syncopal event that occurred while she was walking. Cardiac examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, heard best at the right upper sternal border. There is radiation of the murmur into the neck. The valvular abnormality that most likely caused this episode is
aortic insufficiency or aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis.","### Answer: aortic insufficiency
### Explanation: In patients who have an aortic insufficient lesion and no other cardiovascular disease, syncope can occur during exercise due to vasodilation and pooling of blood in the lower extremities. This results in decreased venous return to the heart and reduced cardiac output.
Aortic stenosis does not cause syncope because it causes obstruction to outflow from the left ventricle; therefore, there would be increased pressure within the left ventricle and increased preload on the myocardium. As a result, stroke volume would increase and cardiac output would remain normal even when the patient exercises.
Mitral regurgitation also does not lead to syncope since it increases the amount of blood returning to the left atrium and left ventricle. Therefore, the left ventricle becomes hyperdynamic and has adequate reserve capacity to maintain cardiac output despite any degree of exercise.
In patients with isolated mitral stenosis, the diastolic murmur is usually audible only at the apex. If the murmur radiates to the carotids, then the lesion must involve the aoic valve (either alone or along with the mitral valve).
The murmurs associated with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy are systolic and often loudest at the base of the hea. They tend to decrease in intensity with Valsalva maneuvers.
Patients with constrictive pericarditis typically present with signs of right ventricular failure, including ascites, pedal edema, and jugular vein distention.
Diastolic murmurs are frequently heard in patients with systemic hypeension but are rarely indicative of significant valvular disease.

"Three weeks ago a 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of frostbite of both feet. He was treated by rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet. All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?
Amputation or Application of topical collagenase or Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes or Hyperbaric oxygen.","### Answer: Amputation
### Explanation: Frostbite injury can lead to gangrene if there is extensive tissue damage from freezing. In this case, amputation would be indicated since all of the toes are involved. If only pa of the toe were affected, debridement might suffice. Collagenase (Santyl) is used to treat noninfected ulcers but not infected wounds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is useful when gas gangrene develops after trauma. It does not help with frostbite injuries.

The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?
Displacement of the nucleus pulposus or Hypertrophy of the facet joints or Osteophyte formation or Spondylolisthesis.","### Answer: Displacement of the nucleus pulposus
### Explanation: This patient presents with acute sciatica due to herniated disc. Sciatic nerve innervates both S1 and S2 spinal segments; thus, it can be affected by any pathology affecting these levels. Herniated intervertebral disk occurs when the central gelatinous core protrudes through the outer fibrous ring into the epidural space. Injury to the annulus fibrosis results from increased intradisk pressure secondary to trauma (lifting), inflammation, or aging. Traumatic injuries tend to occur posteriorly, whereas degenerative changes usually involve the posterolateral aspect of the disk. Loss of hydration within the disk leads to decreased flexibility and increased susceptibility to injury. Degenerative changes include calcification, liquefaction, fragmentation, and desiccation. Calcific disks typically present with chronic lower back pain and stiffness. Disk displacements result in compression of neural structures.
Hypertrophy of the facet joints causes osteoarthritis, which does not cause radicular pain. Osteophytes form along the edges of the vertebrae but would not compress the sciatic nerve. Spondylosis refers to degenerative changes involving the superior and inferior articulatory surfaces of adjacent vertebrae. It also does not produce radicular pain.
Diagnosis: Acute lumbosacral strain
Treatment: Rest, analgesics, muscle relaxants, physical therapy

"A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm where he scraped it on a tree branch 2 days ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (101°F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?
Disruption of vascular basement membranes or Increased hydrostatic pressure or Release of thromboxane or Separation of endothelial junctions.","### Answer: Disruption of vascular basement membranes
### Explanation: Vascular permeability increases during inflammation due to increased expression of adhesive molecules that allow leukocytes to migrate out of blood vessels into tissues. Leukocyte migration leads to disruption of vascular basement membrane proteins, which allows fluid to escape from capillaries. This process does not involve changes in hydrostatic pressure or lymphatic flow. Thromboxane release causes platelet aggregation but has no effect on vascular permeability. Endothelin-1 stimulates contraction of smooth muscle cells within blood vessels; however, these effects would decrease rather than increase vascular permeability. Cytokine production can cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability through direct action on endothelium.

Option B: Hydrostatic pressure is responsible for movement of fluid across capillary walls toward interstitial space. It is constant throughout body tissue.
Option C: Thromboxane A2 is produced by platelets and promotes their aggregation.
Option D: Intercellular gaps between endothelial cells are normally very small. During inflammation, there is an increase in permeability caused by increased expression of adhesive molecules allowing leukocytes to migrate out of blood vessels into tissues.
Option E: Cytokines produce vasodilation and increased vascular permeability through direct action on endothelium.

She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2 . Her hemoglobin A1c is 6.2%, and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118 mg/dL. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time?
Dietary modification for weight loss or Human papillomavirus testing or Mammography or Influenza virus vaccine.","### Answer: Dietary modification for weight loss
### Explanation: This young woman does not need any screening tests because she is asymptomatic and has no risk factors other than family history of breast cancer. However, she needs counseling on maintaining an optimal body mass index through dietary modifications. Screening guidelines have been established based on age, sex, and comorbidities; therefore, it is important that patients be aware of their own risks and discuss them with their physicians.
Screening recommendations include:
• Papanicolaou test every 3 years from ages 21–64 years
• Colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 50 years
• Mammogram annually beginning at age 40 years

Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf) or Decreased hydrostatic pressure or Decreased oncotic pressure or Increased hydrostatic pressure.","### Answer: Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf)
### Explanation: Whenever there is an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure, Kf increases and when it decreases, Kf also decreases. So, if we decrease the efferent arteriolar radius, then the capillary hydrostatic pressure would be increased.

"A 47-year-old man is admitted to the hospital through the emergency department because of the sudden onset of palpitations, left-sided chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath that began while he was watching television 2 hours ago. Medical history is remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . ECG obtained in the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complex. Pulse was 146/min. Physical examination was remarkable for rapid heart rate. The patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol 5 mg every 5 minutes for a total of 15 mg. His pulse slowed to 90/min. Two hours after admission, he is pain free but his pulse is now 160/min. Blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg. In order to decrease the patient's pulse, which of the following should be administered intravenously?
Digoxin or Enalapril or Lidocaine or Metoprolol.","### Answer: Digoxin
### Explanation: This patient has atrial fibrillation complicated by acute myocardial infarction. He was initially treated with IV metoprolol, which decreased his pulse from 146/min to 90/min. However, since then his pulse has increased back up to 160/min. Since this patient is experiencing an increase in ventricular rate despite treatment with beta blockers, it would be reasonable to add digoxin to his medication regimen. Digoxin acts primarily on the AV node, where its primary effect is to decrease conduction velocity. It also increases the ERP and refractory period of the AV node. These effects result in a decrease in the maximum rate of impulses conducted down the AV bundle. Therefore, when added to a beta blocker, digoxin is effective in controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. If the patient were not experiencing atrial fibrillation, enalapril could be used to control his blood pressure. Lidocaine is useful only during cardioversion attempts; therefore, it is not indicated here. Metoprolol is already being used to treat the patient's tachycardia, and adding another drug that works similarly would have no additional benefit. Verapamil is similar to diltiazem in mechanism of action and would not provide any additional benefits.

"A 73-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of diffuse weakness and tingling of her arms and legs. Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Sensation to vibration and position is decreased in all extremities, but the decrease is more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following vitamins?
Vitamin B1 (thiamine) or Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) or Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) or Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin).","### Answer: Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)
### Explanation: Peripheral neuropathy due to vitamin B12 deficiency presents with symmetric distal sensory loss and motor weakness that predominates in the lower limbs. In addition, there can be impaired proprioception and vibratory sense. Pyridoxine deficiency causes seizures, dementia, and peripheral neuritis. Riboflavin deficiency leads to cheilosis, glossitis, and dermatitis. Thiamine deficiency results in beriberi, Wernicke encephalopathy, and Korsakoff psychosis. Deficiencies of niacin and pantothenate cause pellagra and diarrhea, respectively.
Diagnosis: Vitamin B12 deficiency
Laboratory findings:
Serum:
Increased homocysteine level
Decreased methylmalonic acid level
RBC:
Macrocytic anemia
Peripheral blood smear: Macrocytes
Marrow: Megaloblastic anemia
Nerve conduction studies: Decreased amplitude of compound action potentials; prolonged latency of F waves

"Over 1 year, a study is conducted to assess the antileukemic activity of a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. All patients enrolled in the study are informed that they would be treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. They are assigned to successive dose cohorts of 300 to 1000 mg/day of the drug. Six to eight patients are assigned to each dose. Treatment efficacy is determined based on the results of complete blood counts and bone marrow assessments conducted regularly throughout the study. This study is best described as which of the following?
Case-control study or Crossover study or Open-labeled clinical trial or Randomized clinical trial.","### Answer: Open-labeled clinical trial
### Explanation: In an open-label clinical trial, all participants know their group assignment (i.e., treatment vs control). In this case, because both groups receive the same intervention (the experimental drug), it can be considered equivalent to having no placebo arm. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) compares two different treatments; neither participant knows his or her group assignment until after the study has begun. Because there is only one treatment being tested here, this cannot be classified as an RCT. A crossover design allows subjects to switch from one group to another during the course of the study. Neither group receives any special information regarding its status. Subjects who cross over have already been exposed to the experimental condition, but not yet to the alternative therapy. Case-control studies compare individuals with disease to those without disease. Both groups must be comparable in terms of age, sex, race, etc. Ref: Park's Textbook Of Preventive And Social Medicine By K.

"A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?
Carvedilol or Furosemide or Metoprolol or Phentolamine.","### Answer: Carvedilol
### Explanation: This patient has acute coronary syndrome from myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular fibrillation. Aspirin decreases platelet aggregation and prevents further neurological damage if the patient survives. Nitrates dilate coronary arteries and reduce preload; they also decrease systemic vascular resistance and increase venous return. Lorazepam reduces anxiety and can be used to treat hypertensive crisis. Carvedilol is a b blocker with vasodilatory properties that would provide both symptomatic relief and long-term protection against future episodes of angina pectoris. It does not affect mortality but improves morbidity. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that could help relieve dyspnea due to congestive heart failure, but it would worsen hypotension. Metoprolol is another b blocker that provides only sho-term relief of symptoms. Phentolamine is an alpha-blocker that increases peripheral resistance and decreases cardiac output, which would exacerbate hypotension. Thrombolytic agents are indicated when there is evidence of thrombus formation within the coronary circulation. They are contraindicated here since the patient presents with hemodynamic instability.
About option 'd' - Phentolamine is a nonselective α-adrenergic antagonist that blocks all subtypes of these receptors. It is used primarily to reverse the effects of antihypertensives, particularly prazosin, terazosin, and phenoxybenzamine.

"A phase 2, multicenter trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of a new vaccine for prevention of HIV infection. The study enrolled 4000 subjects, aged 20 to 65 years. Of these subjects, 2100 were men and 1900 were women; 2500 were white, 1000 were African American, 300 were Hispanic, and 200 were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. Which of the following is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects?
HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations or The study was not blinded or There was a Type II error or Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure.","### Answer: The study was not blinded
### Explanation: Post-hoc analyses can be misleading because they introduce additional sources of bias into the study design. In this case, if the race of participants had been unknown to both investigators and patients during the course of the study (i.e., double-blind), then it would have been impossible to identify any differences between groups that might have influenced the results. If the study had been single-blinded (investigator knew group assignment but patient did not know), then there could still be bias introduced from the knowledge of the investigator regarding which group each subject belonged to. This type of bias is called ""analysis by subgroup."" Analysis by subgroup occurs when an individual analyzes data based on subgroups within the larger population being studied. For example, in this scenario, the investigator analyzed the data according to racial background. Subgroup analysis has several limitations. First, it introduces another level of complexity into the study design. Second, it increases the risk of false positive findings due to multiple testing. Third, it makes it difficult to interpret the results of the main hypothesis test. Finally, it requires large sample sizes to detect meaningful differences between subgroups.

"A 33-year-old male physician reports for a shift in the emergency department. A nurse alerts you that he noticed a faint odor of alcohol near the physician. When approached, the physician appears tired and more disheveled than usual. There is an odor of alcohol on his breath. He is a skilled and talented physician with no known history of substance or alcohol use disorder. He is married with three children, and his wife is pregnant with twins. The physician was recently hired and has had no actions on his license by any state medical board. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Ask the physician if he is sober, and if he says yes, allow him to complete his shift or Explain to the physician that you suspect he is intoxicated and ask him to submit to a blood sample to check his blood alcohol concentration or Relieve the physician of duty and alert the hospital's patient safety officer or Tell the physician that you can cover the remainder of the shift alone, so that he can sleep in his office.","### Answer: Ask the physician if he is sober, and if he says yes, allow him to complete his shift
### Explanation: This case involves a competent physician who is suspected of being impaired due to alcohol consumption. If this were a resident or intern, it would be necessary to relieve them from their duties immediately because they could potentially harm patients. However, since this is a highly trained attending physician, there is little risk to allowing him to continue working provided that he does not pose a danger to himself or others. In addition, the physician must have been aware of the risks associated with drinking before coming to work; therefore, he cannot complain later when disciplinary action is taken against him. It is also possible that the physician did not realize how much he drank until after arriving at work. Therefore, asking him if he feels well enough to perform his duties safely is reasonable. If he denies having consumed alcohol, then it is likely that he is telling the truth and poses no threat to anyone. If he admits to consuming alcohol, however, then he should be asked to leave and allowed to rest before returning to work. Refusal to take a blood test would raise suspicions, but it would still be unethical to force someone to undergo testing unless evidence exists that they are currently intoxicated. Finally, it is never acceptable to lie to protect another person. Lying to protect oneself is understandable, but lying to protect another person is considered unethical behavior.
In summary, the best course of action here is to first determine if the physician is capable of performing his duties safely. If he is able to function normally, then he should be allowed to finish his shift. If he is unable to function normally, then he should be sent home. Since this is a highly qualified physician, it is unlikely that he will admit to drinking alcohol while on call. Even if he does admit to drinking, he probably won't say anything about it to anyone else. So, even though this situation presents ethical challenges, the decision made here is correct.
If the physician refuses to cooperate, then he should be reported to the authorities. Reporting the physician to the authorities would result in severe consequences for both parties involved. First, the physician would lose his job and possibly face criminal charges. Second, the reporting physician might suffer repercussions from colleagues or superiors. Third, the reputation of the institution where the incident occurred would be damaged. Fourth, the public trust in medicine would be eroded. Fifth, the physician's family members (e.g., spouse, parents, siblings) would suffer collateral damage. Sixth, the physician's future career prospects would be severely limited. Seventh, the physician's personal relationships would be strained. Eighth, the physician's mental health would be negatively affected. Ninth, the physician's physical health would be compromised. Tenth, the physician's ability to practice medicine effectively would be diminished. Eleventh, the physician's professionalism would be questioned. Twelfth, the physician's credibility would be lost. Thirteenth, the physician's integrity would be called into question. Fourteenth, the physician's reliability would be doubted. Fifteenth, the physician's judgment would be scrutinized. Sixteenth, the physician's maturity would be questioned. Seventeenth, the physician's accountability would be examined. Eighteenth, the physician's responsibility would be evaluated. Nineteenth, the physician's dependability would be assessed. Twentieth, the physician's honesty would be investigated.
The above list shows all the negative outcomes that could occur if the physician is reported to the authorities. These consequences would affect everyone concerned, including the physician, the patient, the hospital staff, the community, and society as a whole. Thus, it is clear why reporting the physician to the authorities is not recommended.
However, despite these dire consequences, sometimes reporting the physician to the authorities is justified. For example, if the physician is endangering the lives of patients, then immediate action needs to be taken. Similarly, if the physician is abusing drugs or alcohol, then immediate action needs to be taken. In cases like these, reporting the physician to the authorities is warranted. But only in extreme situations should the authorities be contacted. Otherwise, the consequences listed above should be avoided.
It is important to note that the physician's privacy rights need to be respected. Before taking",Relieve the physician of duty and alert the hospital's patient safety officer
"A 22-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He feels well. He has had a painless left scrotal mass since childhood. Examination shows a 6-cm, soft, nontender left scrotal mass that transilluminates; there are no bowel sounds in the mass. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue or Cryptorchidism of the left testis or Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis or Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis.","### Answer: Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis
### Explanation: Varicocele results from dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis. It can be congenital (primary varicoceles), secondary to increased venous pressure within the body, or acquired through trauma. Inguinal hernias and hydrocoele can also present as scrotal masses but would not have been present throughout life. Scrotal adiposity does occur with aging, but it is usually symmetrical. Cryptorchidism leads to an absent testicle rather than a palpable mass. Patent processus vaginalis allows passage of peritoneal fluid into the scrotum, which could lead to a hydrocele but not a varicocele.
Diagnosis: Varicocele
Symptom: Painless left scrotal mass that transilluminates
Physical finding: Soft, nontender left scrotal mass
Differential diagnosis: Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue, Cryptorchidism of the left testis, Hydrocele, Patent processus vaginalis

Ref - researchgate.net
​​​
Key Concept:
A varicocele is a dilated pampiniform plexus of veins that occurs when valves become incompetent.
It is associated with infertility and hypogonadism.
The clinical presentation includes a swelling in the region of the spermatic cord.
Treatment involves ligation of the affected veins.

Varicocele

A varicocele is a collection of blood in the veins draining the testicles.
It is caused by poor function of the valves in these veins.
This causes backward flow of blood and pooling in the veins.
As a result, the veins enlarge and stretch, causing discomfort and cosmetic concern.

Causes & Risk Factors

There are several risk factors for developing a varicocele. These include:

Age
Male gender
Family history of varicoceles
Increased intraabdominal pressure
Pregnancy
Obesity
Prolonged standing
Smoking

Signs & Symptoms

Many men who develop a varicocele experience symptoms related to this condition. Common signs and symptoms include:

Swollen veins in the scrotum
Testicular pain
Scrotal tenderness
Bulge in the scrotum
Discoloration of the skin overlying the scrotum

Complications

If untreated, a varicocele can lead to complications including:

Chronic inflammation of the scrotum (chronic epididymitis)
Decrease in fertility due to decreased sperm count
Hypogonadism
Rarely, a varicocele can rupture and bleeding can occur in the scrotum. This is called a hematocele.

Diagnosis

To make a definitive diagnosis of a varicocele, your doctor will perform a physical examination. During this examination, he or she will look for a bulging vein near the top of each testicle. If you have a varicocele, the vein may feel like a bagpipe filled with air.

Imaging tests

Your doctor may order imaging tests if they suspect another problem that might be contributing to your varicocele. Imaging tests used to evaluate varicoceles include:

Ultrasound
CT scan
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
Doppler ultrasonography

Treatment

Once a varicocele is suspected, treatment options are discussed. Treatment typically involves surgery. Surgical procedures used to treat varicoceles include:

Embolization
Ligation of the affected veins
Venous stripping

Aftercare

Following surgery, patients recover quickly. They often notice improvement in their symptoms immediately after the procedure. After recovery, many men report improved sexual performance and better semen production. Men who undergo embolization therapy may need additional follow-up care",Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis

### Explanation: This child has staphylococcal scald skin syndrome caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which can be treated with fluoroquinolones. MRSA strains have become increasingly prevalent among hospitalized patients and those who live in nursing homes. They produce an exfoliative toxin that causes desquamation of the epidermis. Patients develop vesicles on their trunk and extremities that rupture easily; these lesions then form bullae that separate into sheets. These bacteria also cause pneumonia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, and abscesses. Treatment requires antibiotics effective against MRSA, including vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, minocycline, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Intravenous administration of antibiotics is usually necessary until clinical improvement occurs. Topical therapy with mafenide acetate cream is indicated when there are no systemic signs of illness. Mild cases respond well to topical treatment alone.

"A 35-year-old man with spina bifida is admitted to the hospital for a urologic procedure. He has been functionally independent in activities of daily living and is employed doing inventory control in a local sporting goods store. He has maintained continence through periodic self-catheterization. The patient is paraplegic, has recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones, and recent onset of incontinence secondary to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. Aside from paraplegia, lower extremity muscle atrophy, and lower abdominal surgical scars, the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. He had an episode of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation for functional expansion of his bladder through a bowel anastomosis. Which of the following is most important to consider in the care of this patient?
Administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes or Preparation of food by outside contractors or Type of cleaning agents used to sterilize bed linens or Use of rubber urethral catheters.","### Answer: Administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes
### Explanation: Latex allergies can cause severe reactions that include respiratory compromise, cardiovascular collapse, and death. In addition to avoidance of latex products (e.g., gloves), patients who have experienced anaphylactic reactions require desensitization before future exposure. This process involves administration of increasing doses of latex extract over several weeks. Patients must be monitored closely throughout the process; if they experience any symptoms, the program is stopped immediately. If the patient experiences another reaction after completion of the desensitization program, he would need to carry epinephrine autoinjectors. Because of the risk of anaphylaxis, it is not advisable to use latex products when caring for this patient. Disposable plastic syringes are available for administering injectable medications. Food preparation by outside contractors does not pose a problem because there is no cross-reactivity between natural rubber latex and other plant proteins. Cleaning agents used to sterilize bed linens are unlikely to produce anaphylaxis. Rubber urethral catheters are avoided in patients with known latex sensitivity but are otherwise safe.

In discussing repair of the hernia with the parents, it is most appropriate to inform them of which of the following?
Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 2 years because many hernias close spontaneously or Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 12 years because oligospermia does not develop before age 12 or Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time or Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled as an emergency operation.","### Answer: Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time
### Explanation: Although there is no evidence that delaying surgery increases the risk of testicular atrophy and infertility, early elective surgical correction of congenital inguinal hernias is recommended. Delaying surgery beyond infancy is associated with increased rates of recurrence.
Option B: Oligospermia occurs after untreated indirect inguinal hernia in adulthood (not childhood).
Option D: Emergent surgery is indicated only if strangulation occurs.
Option E: Surgery is done under GA.
Option C: No need to schedule urgently.

Educational point

An indirect inguinal hernia is defined as a protrusion of intraabdominal contents through the inguinal canal. It is the most common form of hernia.

Anatomy

The inguinal canal is formed by the transversalis fascia and the parietal layer of the external oblique aponeurotic fibers.

The inguinal canal is divided into two parts by the inferior epigastric artery.

The upper part of the inguinal canal contains the spermatic cord in men and the round ligament of the uterus in women.

The lower part of the inguinal canal communicates with the rectovesical pouch via the deep inguinal ring.

This communication allows the passage of bowel loops into the inguinal canal.

The inguinal canal is closed above by the processus vaginalis.

The inguinal canal is closed below by the inferior epigastric vessels.

The inguinal canal is patent throughout life except in cases of obstetric injury.

The inguinal canal is narrowest at its level of entry into the labium majus in women and the scrotum in men.

The inguinal canal is widest at its exit into the",Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time
"A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dizziness for 6 weeks. When she stands up suddenly, she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before she is able to walk. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, a diuretic, a β-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her pulse is 55/min. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg in the right arm and 70/50 mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg in the right arm and 50/30 mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Cardiac stress scintigraphy or Adjusting her medication regimen or Warfarin therapy or Transesophageal echocardiography.","### Answer: Cardiac stress scintigraphy
### Explanation: This patient has orthostatic hypotension due to carotid stenosis. In this case, it was caused by reversible vasospasm from taking a nonselective beta blocker. It can be treated with selective alpha receptor antagonists like prazosin. If there were any signs of myocardial infarction, then cardiac catheterization would have been indicated.
Diagnostic tests that might be considered include Doppler studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomographic (CT) scan, transcranial Doppler sonography, and carotid angiography.
The diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension requires a sustained decrease in systolic BP >20 mmHg or diastolic BP >10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming the upright position. Orthostatic intolerance refers to symptoms related to postural changes, including syncope, presyncope, dizziness, nausea, diaphoresis, pallor, and fatigue.
In patients who experience recurrent episodes of orthostatic hypotension, tilt table testing may help determine if the problem is primarily vascular or neurogenic. Tilting the body forward causes a rapid increase in venous return and decreases in systemic vascular resistance and heart rate.
If the patient experiences symptomatic hypotension during head-up tilt testing, the test is positive. However, even when the test result is negative, orthostatic hypotension may still occur on standing.
Patients with severe orthostatic hypotension may require treatment with fludrocortisone acetate, which increases plasma volume and alters renal hemodynamics. Fludrocortisone also enhances sodium retention and suppresses potassium excretion.
Drugs used to treat orthostatic hypotension include midodrine, octreotide, phenylephrine, clonidine, and droxidopa. Midodrine is a selective α agonist that acts on the sympathetic nervous system to raise mean arterial pressure. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that raises blood pressure through direct vasoconstriction. Phenylephrine is a selective α agonist that raises blood pressure by increasing peripheral vascular resistance. Clonidine is a centrally acting α2 adrenergic receptor agonist that lowers central sympathetic outflow and thereby reduces peripheral vascular resistance. Droxidopa is a prodrug that is decarboxylated into L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). L-DOPA crosses the blood–brain barrier and stimulates dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

"A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had a menstrual period for 6 months. The patient is unconcerned about the lack of menses. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses had occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. She is a member of her high school gymnastics team. She appears emaciated. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb); BMI is 15 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea?
Hyperthyroidism or Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or Hypothyroidism or Polycystic ovarian syndrome.","### Answer: Hyperthyroidism
### Explanation: Thyrotoxicosis can be associated with amenorrhea due to increased sympathetic activity that suppresses GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus. This results in decreased LH and FSH production by the pituitary gland. Increased thyroid hormone levels also decrease estradiol synthesis by the ovary. Patients with hyperprolactinemia have anovulation secondary to suppression of GnRH release. These patients often present with galactorrhea, infertility, and failure to lactate after delivery. Hypothalamic dysfunction leads to hypoestrogenic anovulation. PCOS causes chronic anovulation due to elevated luteinizing hormone (LH), which stimulates excessive testosterone production by the ovary. Testosterone interferes with normal follicular development and prevents ovulation. Osteoporosis occurs when there is insufficient estrogen production to maintain bone mass.
Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism
Symptoms: Weight loss, tachycardia, nervousness, heat intolerance, sweating, diarrhea, muscle weakness, fatigue, irritability, palpitations, tremors, anxiety, paranoid psychosis, exophthalmous, fine skin wrinkles, warm moist skin, thinning hair, enlargement of tongue, proximal myopathy,",Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He was delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. His birth weight was 3500 g (7 lb 11 oz), and Apgar scores were 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At the age of 15 months, physical examination showed no abnormalities, but he was not yet talking. Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school, and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade. He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. He is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. He appears irritable, he resists making eye contact, and he is flapping his hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Frameshift mutation or Missense mutation or Nonsense mutation or Trinucleotide repeat expansion.","### Answer: Frameshift mutation
### Explanation: This child has autism spectrum disorder. Autistic children have difficulty communicating socially and often show repetitive behaviors. They also tend to be mentally retarded. In addition, they can have seizures, which usually respond poorly to anticonvulsants. There is a strong genetic component; approximately half of affected individuals have a family history positive for autism. Mutations that result in frameshifts, premature stop codons, or loss of function are common causes of autism. These types of mutations affect protein structure and function. For example, fragile X syndrome results from a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion on chromosome 47. This leads to mental retardation, macroorchidism, hyperextensible joints, and large ears. It does not typically include features of autism. Down syndrome occurs due to triplication of chromosome 21. While it includes many of the same findings as fragile X syndrome, there is no association between down syndrome and autism.

Autism Spectrum Disorders

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by impairment in social interaction and communication, and restricted interests and activities.
The core symptoms of ASDs are persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts.
These manifest as marked impairment in verbal and nonverbal communication skills, lack of social reciprocity, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities.
In addition, many people with ASDs exhibit unusual motor movements, including hand flapping, rocking, spinning, and perseverative movements.
Many individuals with ASDs have intellectual disability, defined as IQ <70.
However, some individuals with ASDs have average or above-average intelligence.
There is considerable variability within the range of ASDs, and each individual with an ASD presents with unique strengths and challenges.


Etiopathogenesis

The etiologies of ASDs involve complex interplay among environmental factors and genetics.
While the exact mechanisms underlying these conditions remain unclear, research suggests that both heritable and nongenetic risk factors contribute to their development.
Genetic studies suggest that ASDs are highly familial, with recurrence rates estimated at 18% when an older sibling has an ASD.
A number of copy number variations (CNVs) have been identified in individuals with ASDs, particularly those involving the 15q11-13 region, which contains several genes encoding synaptic proteins.
Mutations in other genes involved in neural development, signal transduction, and brain organization have also been described.
For example, mutations in SHANK3, a gene encoding a scaffold protein critical for neuronal connectivity, have been associated with ASDs.
Additionally, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, play important roles in regulating gene expression during fetal development and throughout life.
Abnormalities in prenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and bisphenol A (BPA), have been linked to increased risk for developing ASDs.
Maternal diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drug use have all been associated with increased risk for having a child with an ASD.
Prenatal exposure to valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin has been associated with increased risk for having a child with an ASD.

"A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Arterial blood gas analysis or Examination of sputum for eosinophils or Sweat chloride test or Sputum cytology.","### Answer: Arterial blood gas analysis
### Explanation: This patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD can be divided into two major categories: emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema refers to destruction of alveolar walls; it usually occurs from cigarette smoking but also can occur after exposure to air pollution. Chronic bronchitis involves inflammation and scarring of large airways. Both conditions lead to increased resistance to airflow through the lungs. Increasing age, male sex, and cigarette smoking predispose patients to develop these diseases. Although there is no specific treatment that reverses either condition, oxygen therapy improves survival in severe cases. Arterial blood gases help determine if hypoxemia exists and thus would indicate need for supplemental oxygen. Eosinopenia on sputum examination suggests asthma rather than COPD. Sweat chloride testing is used to screen children suspected of having cystic fibrosis. Sputum cytology is not useful in this case.
Aspiration pneumonia is an acute process caused by aspiration of food, liquids, or other materials into the trachea and lower respiratory passages. It typically presents within hours of ingestion of material. Patients present with fever, tachypnea, dyspnea, and crackles on auscultation. Chest radiographs show evidence of consolidated lung parenchyma. Treatment includes antibiotics directed against common pathogens plus supportive care.
Pleural effusion is characterized by accumulation of fluid between the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura. Pleural effusions are classified based upon their transudative versus exudative nature. Transudates are associated with causes such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, uremia, and hypoproteinemia. Exudates are seen in bacterial infection, malignancy, collagen vascular disorders, and postoperatively. On physical examination, pleuritic pain is often present. Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds are found when the affected hemithorax is palpated. Decrease in diaphragmatic excursion results in diminished chest expansion during inspiration.

"A 37-year-old woman with right lower extremity edema is evaluated because of the sudden onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is made. Which of the following signs, if present on physical examination, would be the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient?
Increased jugular venous pressure or P2 louder than A2 or Peripheral edema or Presence of an S3.","### Answer: Increased jugular venous pressure
### Explanation: Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) can occur from any cause that increases resistance to blood flow through the pulmonary circulation. PAH results in elevated pressures within the pulmonary vascular system. This increased pressure causes backward transmission of pressure into the right side of the heart, which leads to enlargement of the central veins. Jugular venous distention occurs when these veins become engorged. Elevated jugular venous pressure is therefore the most reliable sign of PAH. In addition, patients with PAH often have dyspnea upon exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral cyanosis.
Option B: The intensity of the second sound (P2 ) depends not only on the size of the ventricle but also on the degree of stiffening of the left ventricle wall. Stiffening of the left ventricle wall occurs secondary to chronically high left ventricular end diastolic pressures. Therefore, the intensity of the second sound does not necessarily reflect the presence of pulmonary hypertension.
Options C and D: Both peripheral edema and the presence of an S3 are nonspecific findings that could result from either congestive heart failure or PAH. However, they are less likely to be seen in patients with PAH compared with those who have CHF.
Option E: The third heart sound (S3 ) is caused by rapid filling of the ventricles during early systole. It usually becomes audible after the age of 40 years. Its appearance is related to the increase in the volume of the contracting ventricle. Thus, it is unlikely to be heard in young adults.
The first heart sound (S1 ) is produced by the closure of the tricuspid valve. The opening snap (OS) is produced by the opening of the mitral valve. The OS is followed immediately by the OS + A2 complex, which represents both the opening of the semilunar valves and the beginning of the ejection phase of the cardiac cycle. The duration of the OS + A2 complex varies depending on the rate of ejection of the left ventricle. The OS + A2 complex is prolonged in conditions associated with decreased ejection rates. These include LV hyperophy, LV dilatation, and severe AR. The OS + A2 complex is shoened in conditions associated with increased ejection rates. These include HOCM, acute MI, and severe MS.
A loud P2 is indicative of a large left ventricle. The normal ratio between the intensities of the two sounds is approximately 1:0.5. When the intensity of the P2 exceeds that of the A2, the condition is called pansystolic murmur. Such a finding is characteristic of LV hyperophy.
The intensity of the S1 is affected by the state of the respiratory mechanism. During inspiration, the diaphragm descends, causing the intrapleural pressure to decrease below atmospheric pressure. As a consequence, the lung recoils toward its resting position. This movement produces a slight decrease in the diameter of the thoracic cavity. Consequently, the amplitude of the S1 is reduced. At expiration, the opposite process occurs. The amplitude of the S1 is maximized just before the peak of the inspiratory effort.
The intensity of the S1 is also influenced by the viscosity of the blood. Viscous blood tends to reduce the amplitude of the S1.
The intensity of the S1 is also affected by the elastic properties of the myocardium. Elastic recoil of the myocardium contributes to the production of the S1.
The intensity of the S1 is also affected by the thickness of the chest wall. Thickening of the chest wall reduces the amplitude of the S1.
The intensity of the S1 is also affected by the state of the pericardium. If the pericardium is inflamed, the amplitude of the S1 is increased.
The intensity of the S1 is also affected by the state of the lung. The amplitude of the S1 is reduced if there is air trapped within the alveoli.
The intensity of the S1 is also affected by the state of the abdominal organs. For example, the amplitude of the S1 is reduced if the liver is enlarged.
The intensity of the S1 is also affected by the state of the thoracic cage. For example, the amplitude of",P2 louder than A2
"A 32-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 41 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. At the beginning of the second stage of labor, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration to 60/min. The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath, rapidly develops cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Immediate resuscitation is started. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Amniotic fluid embolism or Intracerebral hemorrhage or Myocardial infarction or Status asmaticus.","### Answer: Amniotic fluid embolism
### Explanation: This case describes an amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). AFEs occur when fetal or maternal tissues enter the mother’s circulatory system during delivery. They can cause cardiac arrest due to hypotension caused by vasodilation and airway obstruction secondary to aspiration of the embolized material. In addition, they can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which causes bleeding into the skin and other organs. DIC also leads to thrombocytopenia, which explains why the patient was not able to be bled after her initial collapse. There were no signs of trauma that could explain the bleeding. Although myocardial infarctions have similar presenting symptoms, they would not result in bleeding. Asphyxia does not account for the sudden loss of vital signs. Intracranial hemorrhages usually produce focal neurologic deficits rather than generalized ones.

"A 52-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of severe dyspnea and cough productive of tenacious, brownishyellow sputum for the past 3 weeks. He has a 15-year career history of sandblasting old buildings. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. The patient is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 94/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. On physical examination he is in moderately severe distress with pursed lips and cyanotic nail beds. Chest has an increased anteroposterior diameter. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered wheezes and rhonchi over all lung fields. Cardiac examination discloses muffled heart sounds and an S4. Fingers are clubbed. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?
Azathioprine therapy or Bronchoscopy or Continuous humidified oxygen or Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).","### Answer: Bronchoscopy
### Explanation: This patient has bronchiectasis due to chronic inflammatory damage from his occupation. Bronchial biopsy would confirm this diagnosis. Bronchoscopic removal of secretions can be therapeutic. Azathioprine therapy might help prevent recurrences but does not treat established disease. Oxygen therapy helps relieve hypoxemia but cannot reverse fibrosis. CPAP is used primarily to treat obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Corticosteroids have no role in treating bronchiectasis.

"A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 8 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for her first prenatal visit. She delivered her first child spontaneously at 34 weeks' gestation; pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia. She has no other history of serious illness. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy consistent in size with an 8-week gestation. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?
Abruptio placentae or Fetal chromosome abnormality or Hyperthyroidism or Preterm labor and delivery.","### Answer: Abruptio placentae
### Explanation: Compared to singleton pregnancies, monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA), dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA), and monozygotic twins have higher rates of fetal loss due to cord entanglement, vascular thrombosis, and abruption. MCDAs also carry a high rate of Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS). Dichorionic twins have a lower incidence of prematurity compared to monochorionic twins. Monozygotic twins have a higher incidence of conjoined twins, but this is not relevant here since they would be apparent on ultrasound examination. There is no association between maternal thyrotoxicosis and multiple gestations.

"A 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis comes to the office for a follow-up examination. The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?
Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 or Epidermal growth factor or Interleukin-1 (IL-1) or Tumor necrosis factor α.","### Answer: Tumor necrosis factor α
### Explanation: Inflammation and joint damage associated with ankylosing spondylitis result from overproduction of cytokines, including IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). These proteins stimulate inflammatory cells and cause cartilage destruction. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), epidermal growth factor, interferon gamma, and transforming growth factor beta have no role in this disorder.
In patients who respond poorly to NSAID therapy, sulfasalazine can be tried because it contains both salicylic acid and 5-aminosalicylic acid. If these measures fail, then infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-α, can be used. Infliximab binds to TNF-α on the surface of macrophages and prevents its interaction with receptors. This results in decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines and reduced inflammation.
Another option would be etanercept, another recombinant fusion protein that acts by binding to soluble TNF-α and preventing its interactions with cellular receptors. Etanercept is administered subcutaneously twice weekly. Adverse effects include injection site reaction, fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, and elevated liver enzyme levels.
Etanercept was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the management of moderate to severe RA. It is now indicated for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
Adalimumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against TNF-α. It is administered every other week via s.c. injection. Common adverse events include upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Abatacept is a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 linked to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G1. Abatacept competes with CD28 ligands for access to CD28 receptor sites on activated T lymphocytes. By blocking costimulation signals, abatacept reduces the activation of T cells and subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines. Abatacept is administered i.v. once every two weeks. Adverse effects include serious bacterial infections, hypersensitivity reactions, and mild to moderate neutropenia.
Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the high-affinity IL-2 receptor. Daclizumab is indicated for the prevention of acute organ transplant rejection.
Brodixie is a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Its efficacy compared with celecoxib has recently been demonstrated in clinical trials. Brodixie appears to offer similar benefits to those seen with celecoxib but with fewer side effects related to platelet function.
Methotrexate is a folate analogue that inhibits DNA synthesis by acting as a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor. Methotrexate is effective in treating many types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.
Pentazocine is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic agent. Pentazocine is primarily used for the relief of moderate to severe pain.
Nimesulide is a centrally acting analgesic and antipyretic agent. Nimesulide is structurally unrelated to any known compound. It is believed to act through central nervous system mechanisms.
Paracetamol is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent. Paracetamol is metabolized into several products, including glucuronic acid conjugates, phenolsulfone",Tumor necrosis factor α
"A 50-year-old female presents to the office with the complaints of chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue. Physical examination reveals multiple bilateral tender points in the trapezius, gluteal, and suboccipital muscle groups. Radiograph findings and laboratory study results are normal. The most likely diagnosis is
ankylosing spondylitis or fibromyalgia or myofascial pain syndrome or osteoarthritis.","### Answer: fibromyalgia
### Explanation: Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal symptoms (chronic achy, stiffness, and fatigue), sleep disturbances, headaches, paresthesias, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression. It occurs predominantly in women between ages 40 and 60 years. There is no specific diagnostic test; however, physical examination demonstrates numerous tender points that can be identified using standardized criteria. Laboratory studies usually show normal values. Treatment includes medications for pain relief, antidepressants, and behavior modification therapy.
Ankylosing spondylitis typically affects young men who have HLA-B27 genotype. Onset is insidious with low back pain and morning stiffness. X-ray shows sacroiliitis.
Myofascial pain syndrome is associated with trigger points. Trigger point injection is treatment.
Osteoarthritis has age related onset with joint swelling, crepitus, and tenderness. X-ray shows cartilage destruction.

"An 18-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 10 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to his chest. On arrival, he is unresponsive to painful stimuli. His pulse is 130/min, respirations are 8/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm wound at the left sixth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. The trachea is at the midline. Heart sounds are not audible. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Chest x-ray or Echocardiography or Bronchoscopy or Pericardiocentesis.","### Answer: Chest x-ray
### Explanation: This patient has cardiac tamponade from hemopericardium secondary to penetrating injury of the heart. Cardiac tamponade can be diagnosed clinically when there is decreased arterial pressure (<90/60 mmHg), tachycardia, hypotension during inspiration, absent breath sounds over the precordium, muffled heart sound, and absence of heart sounds. In this case, the patient was hypertensive initially but developed hypotension later on due to cardiac tamponade. A chest radiograph would show an enlarged cardiothoracic ratio, which indicates fluid accumulation within the pericardial sac. If the patient had no signs of tamponade, then echocardiography could have been done to confirm the presence of pericardial effusion. Bronchoscopy is indicated if the patient presents with stridor or dyspnea. Pericardiocentesis is performed only when the patient does not respond to medical therapy.
Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. It occurs when the amount of fluid collected between the visceral and parietal layers of the pericardium exceeds 150–200 mL. When the volume increases beyond this limit, it causes increased pressure within the pericardial cavity, resulting in impairment of diastolic filling of the heart. As a result, stroke volume falls, leading to reduced cardiac output.
The initial symptoms include anxiety, restlessness, and apprehension. Later, patients develop fatigue, weakness, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, pallor, and finally shock. Hypotension is usually present, although occasionally it is absent because of compensatory vasoconstriction. Tachycardia is common; however, bradycardia can also occur. Jugular veins become engorged, and the JVP falls. Pulsus paradoxus is seen in severe cases.
In addition to the above findings, the physical examination reveals diminished or absent heart sounds, muffled heart sounds, and a prominent S3 gallop. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Treatment consists of rapid removal of excess fluid from the pericardial sac through needle aspiration or surgical incision. Needle aspiration is preferred unless the procedure fails repeatedly or the patient cannot tolerate repeated attempts at needle aspiration.
If the patient’s vital signs improve immediately after needle aspiration, further investigation into the cause of the tamponade is warranted. However, if the tamponade recurs, surgery must be considered.
Adequate resuscitation before attempting pericardiocentesis is essential.
Pericardiocentesis is contraindicated in patients who are actively bleeding because of risk of introducing air embolism into the circulation.
ECG changes include low voltage, ST segment elevation, PR depression, QRS complex shortening, and T wave flattening.
Pulmonary edema is rare.

"A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40 pack-year history, and consumes more than 8 cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467 U/L (reference range: 28-100 U/L) and a γ-glutamyltransferase level of 212 U/L (reference range: < 55 U/L).

anterior rami of T1-T5 or anterior rami of T6-T10 or anterior rami of T11-T12 or posterior rami of T1-T5.","### Answer: anterior rami of T6-T10
### Explanation: Pain from the stomach travels along the celiac plexus via the lesser splanchnic nerve (T9), then ascends through the sympathetic chain to reach the C1 segment of the spinal cord. This pathway is called the ""hypogastric plexus."" The greater splanchnic nerve (T10, T11, T12) carries visceral afferent fibers that innervate the pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and other abdominal organs. These fibers also carry pain signals from these areas. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve synapse on the ganglia of the celiac plexus before reaching the GI tract. Therefore, damage to the vagus nerve would lead to loss of parasympathetic function in the intestines but no effect on the celiac plexus.
The anterior rami of T1-T5 innervate the skin over the face, scalp, and upper extremities; therefore, they cannot transmit referred pain from the stomach. The anterior rami of T11-T12 supply the skin over the lower limbs and back; thus, they cannot transmit referred pain from the stomach. The posterior rami of T1-T5 innervate the muscles of the trunk and pelvis; hence, they cannot transmit referred pain from the stomach.

Key Concept
Pain from the stomach travels along the celiac plexus via the lesser splanchnic nerve (T9), then ascends through the sympathetic chain to reach the C1 segment of the spinal cord. This pathway is called the “hypogastric plexus.”
The great splanchnic nerve carries visceral afferent fibers that innervate the pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and other abdominal organs. These fibers also carry pain signals from these areas.
Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve synapse on the ganglia of the celiac plexus before reaching the GI tract. Therefore, damage to the vagus nerve would lead to loss of parasympathetic function in the intestines but no effect on the celiac plexus.
Anterior Rami of Spinal Nerves
The anterior rami of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal nerves arise from their respective segments of the spinal cord. Each anterior ramus contains both sensory and motor axons.
Cervical Anterior Rami
The four cervical nerves have eight pairs of roots each. They leave the spinal column between the skull and the first rib. The two highest cervical nerves (C1 and C2) are very short and have only three pairs of roots each.
The cervical nerves are named according to the vertebrae from which they originate. For example, the C5 nerve arises from the fifth cervical vertebra.
Each pair of cervical roots gives rise to a cervical nerve, except for the last pair, which forms the dorsal primary rami of the cervical nerves.
The cervical nerves are divided into ventral and dorsal divisions. The ventral division consists of the ventral primary rami, whereas the dorsal division consists of the dorsal primary rami.
The ventral primary rami form the brachial plexuses. The dorsal primary rami become the dorsal primary rami of the intercostal nerves.
The ventral primary rami are further subdivided into the anterior primary rami and the posterior primary rami.
The anterior primary rami consist of the ventral primary rami of the C5–C8 nerves. The anterior primary rami of the C5–C7 nerves form the musculocutaneous nerve, whereas those of the C8 nerve form the lateral root of the median nerve.
The posterior primary rami consist of the ventral primary rami of the C8–T1 n",anterior rami of T6-T10
"A 31-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician because of an oozing, foul-smelling wound on her foot for 2 days. Physical examination shows a 4-cm, necrotizing wound with a purplish black discoloration over the heel. Crepitant bullae producing profuse amounts of serous drainage are seen. A Gram stain of a tissue biopsy specimen shows gram-positive rods. The causal organism most likely produces which of the following virulence factors?
Fimbriae or Pneumolysin or Polysaccharide capsule or α-Toxin.","### Answer: Pneumolysin
### Explanation: This patient has necrotizing fasciitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus). Infection begins when S. pyogenes adheres to host epithelia via fibrillar M protein and then invades through desmoglein gaps in intercellular junctions. Once inside the cell, it releases cytotoxins that lyse cells. Pneumolysin is a pore-forming exotoxin that causes hemolysis and lysis of red blood cells. It also contributes to the pathology of necrotizing soft tissue infections. Fimbriated strains cause pharyngitis; polysaccharide capsules protect against complement-mediated bactericidal activity. α-toxin is responsible for the characteristic erythematous skin lesions associated with scarlet fever.
Bartonella henselae causes cat scratch disease, characterized by regional lymphadenopathy and endotheliitis.
Clostridium perfringens causes gas gangrene, characterized by crepitance and putrefaction.

"A 23-year-old woman with bone marrow failure is treated with a large dose of rabbit antithymocyte globulin. Ten days later, she develops fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on her hands and feet. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these symptoms?
Cytokine secretion by natural killer cells or Eosinophil degranulation or Immune complex deposition in tissues or Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation.","### Answer: Cytokine secretion by natural killer cells
### Explanation: This patient has cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which occurs when immunosuppressed patients receive high doses of monoclonal antibodies that bind to CD3 receptors on helper T cells. These antibodies stimulate NK cells to secrete interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, granzyme B, perforin, and other mediators that damage host tissue. CRS can be prevented if glucocoicoids are administered prophylactically.Diagnosis: Cytokine release syndrome
Symptom: Fever, Lymphadenopathy, Arthralgia, Erythema
Cause: Rabbit anti-T cell globulin therapy
Pathogenesis: Stimulation of Natural Killer cells
Microscopic finding: Interstitial inflammation
Treatment: Glucocoicoid administration
Other options:
Option a - Cytokine secretion by natural killer cells
Option b - Eosinophil degranulation
Option c - Immune complex deposition in tissues
Option d - Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation
Key concept:
The use of monoclonal antibody against CD3 receptor leads to polyclonal activation of T cells and subsequent development of cytokine release syndrome.
This condition can be prevented by giving steroids before starting treatment.
If it still develops then supportive care is required.

"A 68-year-old man is in the hospital because he requires mechanical ventilation for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. On the second day after admission he developed a pneumothorax on the right side that required tube thoracostomy. An air leak is noted for the next 24 hours, which now has stopped. However, the patient has become restless and combative. Breath sounds are diminished in the right side of the chest and the patient now has tachycardia. Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. After ordering a STAT portable x-ray of the chest, which of the following is the most appropriate step?
Administer β-blocking medications or Administer alprazolam or Remove the patient from the ventilator and ventilate him with a bag-valve mask or Reposition the chest tube.","### Answer: Reposition the chest tube
### Explanation: This patient has a persistent pneumothorax despite an adequate air leak during the first 24 hours. He also has signs of hypoxemia (diminished breath sounds). Therefore, repositioning the chest tube would be indicated to ensure proper placement. If this fails, then surgical intervention might be necessary.
The other choices are not indicated in this situation.
Option A: β-blockers can cause bronchospasm; therefore they are contraindicated in COPD patients.
Option B: Alprazolam is used only if agitation persists after repositioning the chest tube.
Option D: Removing the patient from the ventilator could lead to respiratory failure due to his severe lung disease.
Option E: Increasing FiO2 would increase oxygen consumption and work of breathing.
Key Concept: Persistent pneumothorax despite an adequate air leak during the first 24 hours indicates repositioning of the chest tube.

"A 45-year-old woman with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/85 mm Hg. Crackles are heard in both lower lung fields. Pulmonary function tests show total lung capacity is 80% of predicted, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for alveolar volume, is 65% of predicted. Histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Diffuse interstitial fibrosis or Intra-alveolar exudates or Multiple thromboemboli or Necrotizing vasculitis.","### Answer: Diffuse interstitial fibrosis
### Explanation: Interstitial lung disease can be caused by many factors including idiopathic causes, drugs, environmental exposures, and connective tissue diseases. Scleroderma is associated with an inflammatory process that leads to scarring of the lungs. This condition typically presents insidiously over months to years with dyspnea on exertion followed by worsening dyspnea and cachexia. Patients often have Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis, esophageal dysmotility, and digital ulcers. There is no specific treatment other than supplemental oxygen therapy; lung transplantation has been performed successfully in selected patients.Interstitial pneumonia is characterized histopathologically by intra-alveolar exudates, usually neutrophils, but sometimes eosinophils or red cells. It is seen in bacterial pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.Multiple thrombi within the pulmonary circulation would lead to pulmonary infarction rather than interstitial fibrosis.Necrotizing vasculitis is characteristic of Wegener granulomatosis, which also involves the upper airways, kidneys, and joints.Diagnosis: Systemic sclerosis, interstitial lung disease

"An epidemic involving 10 individuals of all ages occurs in a migrant worker camp. None of the patients has had any form of immunization. Most cases present with fever, chills, tachypnea, sore throat, swollen glands, and severe malaise. One patient dies from respiratory complications, and another dies from myocardial involvement. A gram-positive rod is isolated from the respiratory tracts of 7 of the patients. The most likely cause of the outbreak is
Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae or Epstein-Barr virus or Haemophilus influenzae.","### Answer: Haemophilus influenzae
### Explanation: Although there have been no recent reports of this disease, it was once common among children who were not vaccinated against Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b). In fact, before the introduction of the polysaccharide vaccine, the incidence rate was estimated to be between 5% and 6%. This organism can infect the upper respiratory tract, lungs, sinuses, ears, eyes, brain, skin, joints, and bloodstream. It causes meningitis, otitis media, pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, septic arthritis, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and conjunctivitis. There are two types of Hib: nontypeable strains that account for approximately 98% of cases; and type b, which accounts for only 2% of cases but is responsible for most serious illnesses. Type b produces an exotoxin that destroys leukocytes and platelets. Nontypeable strains produce a capsular polysaccharide that protects them from phagocytosis. Both types of Hib can also destroy erythrocytes, leading to hemolysis. Patients usually develop symptoms within 4 days after exposure. They include fever, headache, irritability, vomiting, abdominal pain, cough, nasal congestion, and watery eyes. Children under age 5 years tend to get sick faster than older individuals because they lack antibodies produced during previous infections. Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests. Treatment consists mainly of supportive measures, including rest, hydration, analgesics, and antipyretics. Antimicrobial therapy is indicated if the patient’s condition worsens or if he or she develops complications. Ref : Ananthanarayana textbook of Microbiology 9th edition Pgno : 230

"A 29-year-old male presents to the office with the complaints of a pounding heart, poor sleep, and a generalized feeling of restlessness. He relocated 2 months ago to take a promotion and has found himself unable to concentrate on his new duties. He worries about his ability to adapt to his increase in responsibility at work and states that he has called in sick 3 days within the past 2 weeks. The most likely diagnosis is
adjustment disorder with anxious mood or generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.","### Answer: adjustment disorder with anxious mood
### Explanation: Adjustment disorders (with or without depressed mood) can be differentiated from other psychiatric conditions based upon their time course. They develop within 3 months after an identifiable stressor and resolve within 6 months after the stressor. In contrast, symptoms of major depression persist beyond this period.
Adjustment disorders are not characterized by persistent functional impairment. Patients often present themselves for treatment because they feel ""out of sorts"" but have no difficulty functioning.
The patient described here has experienced a recent stressful life event (a move), which led to feelings of anxiety and decreased productivity at work. These symptoms developed shortly after the move and persisted for several weeks before presentation. This pattern suggests an adjustment disorder rather than a chronic condition like major depression.
Anxious mood is common in both adjustment disorders and major depression; however, it tends to predominate in patients with adjustment disorders.
Patients with adjustment disorders tend to deny any suicidal ideation or intentions. Major depression is associated with increased risk for suicide attempts.
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by perfectionism, inflexibility, and attention to detail. It does not include features of anxiety.
Generalized anxiety disorder includes excessive worry, irritability, insomnia, fatigue, muscle tension, and gastrointestinal distress. However, these symptoms must last longer than 6 months to meet diagnostic criteria.
Panic disorder involves recurrent panic attacks accompanied by physical symptoms including palpitations, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath, chills, hot flashes, tremors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, paresthesias, and diaphoresis. Panic attacks usually occur unexpectedly and require immediate medical care.
Social phobia refers to fear of social situations involving possible scrutiny by others. Social avoidance occurs when there is marked distress related to exposure in social situations.

"A new blood test to detect prostate cancer is evaluated in 300 male volunteers. A needle biopsy of the prostate gland is done on all men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL (N<4). One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis. Which of the following is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this test?
Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population or Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen or Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population or Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL.","### Answer: Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population
### Explanation: To determine the sensitivity of a screening test, we must know both its true positive rate and its false negative rate. We can estimate these rates from data collected during the testing process. In this case, we would like to know how many men who actually had prostate cancer were identified correctly by the test (true positives), and how many men who did not have prostate cancer received a diagnosis of prostate cancer (false negatives). These estimates require information that is not provided in the question stem. Specifically, we need to know the prevalence of prostate cancer among the entire group of men tested (not just those with elevated PSA levels). This number represents the percentage of men in the study population who have prostate cancer. If we knew this value, then we could use it along with other available data to compute the desired statistics. For example, if the prevalence of prostate cancer was 1%, then there would be 1% of 300 = 3 men with prostate cancer in the total sample. Of these three men, four would receive a correct diagnosis because they would have been included in the first group of 100 men whose biopsy samples showed evidence of prostate cancer. Thus, the true positive rate would be 4/3 = 133%. Similarly, the remaining 276 men would constitute the second group of men whose biopsy samples showed no evidence of prostate cancer. Among them, only five would receive an incorrect diagnosis of prostate cancer. Therefore, the false negative rate would be 5/276 = 18%. However, we cannot obtain either of these values unless we also know the prevalence of prostate cancer in the larger population being studied.

"A 55-year-old man who is a business executive is admitted to the hospital for evaluation of abdominal pain. He is polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff. The patient's wife and two of his three adult children arrive for a visit. The patient says with disgust that the missing child is and always has been worthless. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior?
Projection or Projective identification or Reaction formation or Splitting.","### Answer: Projection
### Explanation: This patient is projecting onto others (the nurse and other staff members) feelings he cannot acknowledge within himself (hostility toward family members). In projection, unacceptable impulses are attributed to someone else. In reaction formation, an individual adopts behaviors opposite those characteristic of their inner drives; e.g., a sadistic person becomes a surgeon. Identification occurs when a person takes on characteristics of another (e.g., a young girl identifies with her mother); transference involves the redirection of emotions from one object to another (a psychiatric patient falls in love with the doctor). Splitting refers to dividing complex phenomena into polar opposites. Passivity is seen in individuals who feel helpless and attribute all control over events to external forces.

Note: The term ""narcissism"" was coined after Narcissus, a handsome Greek youth who fell in love with his own image reflected in water. It now describes an inflated sense of self-importance.

Key Concept:
Projection is the attribution of one’s own undesirable thoughts or feelings to someone else.

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Lithium carbonate or Methylphenidate or Olanzapine or Paroxetine.","### Answer: Paroxetine
### Explanation: This patient has panic disorder. Panic attacks can be treated acutely with benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam). Long-term treatment involves antidepressants that have additional anti-anxiety effects, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and buspirone. Lithium is used primarily in bipolar disorder; methylphenidate is indicated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; olanzapine is used in schizophrenia; risperidone is also effective in this condition.
Diagnosis: Panic disorder
Treatment: Paroxetine
Reference: Katzung BG. Basic & Clinical Pharmacology. 14th ed. New Delhi: McGraw Hill Medical Publishing Division; 2018. Page 569
​​​​​​​Explanation:
Panic Disorders

A panic attack is characterized by sudden onset of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms resembling those of heart disease, respiratory failure, or other life-threatening conditions. These include tachypnea, tachycardia, sweating, tremor, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, paresthesias, flushing, chills, hot flashes, and sensations of impending doom or death. Attacks usually last between 5 and 30 minutes but occasionally persist for several hours. They occur unexpectedly and recur over time. Between attacks, patients experience persistent concern about future attacks and their consequences.
The diagnosis of panic disorder requires three or more unprovoked panic attacks per month during a period of four weeks or longer. In addition, there must be significant distress related to the attacks or to their associated symptoms. Patients often seek medical care when they believe that they are having a heart attack or stroke.
Patients who develop panic disorder frequently become preoccupied with the possibility of another episode. Many avoid situations where they experienced previous panic attacks. Some patients develop agoraphobia, which is defined as an irrational fear of being in places from which escape would be difficult or embarrassing if help were suddenly needed. Agoraphobia typically begins after the first few panic attacks and progressively restricts activities outside the home.
Benzodiazepine drugs are useful for rapid relief of panic attacks. Antidepressant agents, particularly SSRIs, are effective long-term treatments. Buspirone is less potent than the SSRIs but does not carry the risk of suicidal behavior. Clomipramine was once widely used for panic disorder but has largely been replaced by SSRIs.
Drugs Used in Treatment of Panic Disorder

Antidepressants

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI): Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram
Norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI): Venlafaxine
Traditional TCAs: Amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline
Buspirone
BZDs: Alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam

Note: Clomipramine and venlafaxine are considered second line therapies due to higher incidence of side effects.

Paradoxically, many patients respond better to medications that increase rather than decrease central nervous system activity. For example, benzodiazepines relieve panic attacks almost immediately, whereas SSRIs take up to six weeks to exert full effectiveness. Similarly, carbamazepine, valproate, and topiramate are sometimes prescribed off label for refractory cases.

In contrast to depression, mania, and generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder rarely occurs in conjunction with these other psychiatric illnesses. However, it is important to consider coexisting substance use disorders, especially alcoholism, since both conditions tend to worsen each other.

Most patients recover completely with proper treatment. Recurrence rates vary depending upon the type of treatment provided. Those receiving only drug therapy generally have a greater likelihood of experiencing further panic",Paroxetine
"An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?
Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration or Decreased macrophage activity or Increased basophil count or Increased lymphocyte count.","### Answer: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration
### Explanation: Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects and suppress cellular responses mediated by cytokines. Stressful situations can cause release of glucocorticoid from the adrenal cortex into the bloodstream. This results in decreased levels of circulating cortisol, which would be expected to impair immune function. Macrophages play important roles in inflammation and phagocytosis; their numbers are not affected by stress. Basophils are involved in immediate hypersensitivity reactions and release histamine upon activation. Lymphocytes are critical cells in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Thrombocytopenia occurs when platelets are destroyed rapidly (e.g., in DIC).
Diagnosis: Common cold
Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, cough
Physical examination: Nasal congestion, rhinitis
Laboratory studies: Elevated white blood cell count
Treatment: Rest, analgesics, antibiotics if necessary
Differential diagnoses: Acute sinusitis, influenza

"A 30-year-old nulliparous female presents to the office with the complaint of mood changes. She says that for the past several months she has been anxious, hyperactive, and unable to sleep 3 to 4 days prior to the onset of menses. She further reports that on the day her menses begins she becomes acutely depressed, anorectic, irritable, and lethargic. She has no psychiatric history. Physical examination findings are normal. She and her husband have been trying to conceive for over 2 years. History reveals a tuboplasty approximately 1 year ago to correct a closed fallopian tube. The most likely diagnosis is
adjustment disorder with depressed mood or bipolar I disorder, mixed or cyclothymic personality or generalized anxiety disorder.","### Answer: premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)
### Explanation: Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD): This syndrome consists of severe emotional disturbances occurring during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Symptoms include persistent sadness, anxiety, anger, fatigue, insomnia, weight gain, breast fullness, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and decreased concentration. These symptoms usually begin 7 to 10 days before the onset of menses and resolve within 5 days after the onset of menses. PMDD can be associated with major depressive episodes, but it does not meet criteria for a major depression episode because the symptoms occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Treatment includes SSRIs, benzodiazepines, progesterone, GnRH agonists, and danazol.
Reference: Kaplan & Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 10th Edition, Page 698

Premenstrual Syndromes

The term premenstrual syndrome encompasses all the physical and psychological symptoms experienced by women from ovulation through the first few days following menses. It is estimated that up to 80% of reproductive age women experience these symptoms.

Physical symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating, breast tenderness, fluid retention, headaches, migraines, back pain, myalgia, paresthesias, and vasomotor instability.

Psychologic symptoms include anxiety, appetite disturbance, difficulty concentrating, increased energy, irritability, mood swings, nervousness, restlessness, sexual dysfunction, and sleep disturbances.

Lifetime prevalence rates vary between 3% and 10%. However, when the time frame is restricted to the last week of the follicular phase, the lifetime incidence rate increases to 20%–30%.

A subset of patients who suffer from premenstrual syndrome also exhibit significant functional impairment and marked distress during this period. In fact, many women report that their symptoms interfere significantly with daily activities.

These patients are said to have premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

In addition, they cannot be accounted for by another mental health condition.

Patients with PMS often complain of feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, and guilt.

They may also feel angry, hostile, and violent toward others.

Other common features include suicidal ideation, substance use, and eating problems.

Most cases of PMDD respond well to treatment.

Treatment options include antidepressants, antipsychotic agents, sedative hypnotics, and hormonal therapy.

Because of the high frequency of comorbidity with depression, antidepressant medications are considered the drug of choice.

SSRI drugs appear to be particularly effective.

Progestins are used primarily to treat symptoms related to estrogen excess.

Given early enough in the cycle, they prevent the development of endometrial hyperplasia and reduce the volume of uterine bleeding.

However, if administered later in the cycle, they may actually worsen symptoms.

Estrogens are sometimes prescribed to relieve hot flashes and vaginal dryness.

If taken continuously throughout the month, however, they may exacerbate mood symptoms.

Diagnosis requires that the patient have five or more of the following symptoms during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

At least one of the symptoms must be either depression or anxiety.

Another two symptoms must involve altered mood or affect.

Finally, three additional symptoms must be present.

One of these must be either breast tenderness or body temperature change.

The remaining two must be chosen from a list of ten items including anxiety, crying spells, feeling overwhelmed, fatigue, irritability, mild depression, mood",adjustment disorder with depressed mood
"A 19-year-old college student comes to the physician because of vaginal irritation and pain with urination for 5 days. Two weeks ago, she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?
Bacterial vaginosis or Candidiasis or Chlamydia trachomatis infection or Escherichia coli infection.","### Answer: Bacterial vaginosis
### Explanation: This patient has bacterial vaginosis, which can be caused by multiple organisms but is usually due to Gardnerella vaginitis. It is characterized by an offensive fishy odor that increases after coitus or during menses. Vulvar pruritus is common. The diagnosis is made on microscopic examination of the vaginal secretions. The whiff test involves adding potassium hydroxide solution to the vaginal secretion. If there is no reaction, it indicates a low pH, consistent with lactobacilli predominance. If the mixture turns yellowish green, indicating alkaline pH, then it suggests bacterial vaginosis. Treatment includes metronidazole or clindamycin creams applied intravaginally once daily for 7 days. In this case, the symptoms were probably precipitated by antibiotics used for treatment of group A beta hemolytic strep throat. Diagnoses considered in the other choices would not have resulted in the described clinical picture.Diagnosis: Bacterial vaginosis
""Whiff Test"":

Adding KOH to the vaginal fluid produces a characteristic fishy smell if BV is present.
If the vaginal fluid does not produce any color change when mixed with KOH, it is normal.
A yellowish tint indicates Lactobacillus growth.
Greenish tint indicates Gardnerella vaginitis.

Note:
The ""whiff test"" is positive only in 80% of cases.
It is also important to note that the presence of clue cells is diagnostic of BV. Clue cells are epithelial cells covered with coccobacilli. They appear as squamous epithelial cells with granular cytoplasm and irregular borders.

Key Concept:
Bacterial vaginosis is associated with adverse outcomes in both mother and fetus.
In addition, women who develop bacterial vaginosis are at increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy.
Treatment consists of metronidazole or clindamycin creams applied intravaginally once daily for 7 days.

"A sexually active 23-year-old man with multiple sex partners has dysuria and a yellow urethral exudate. Gram stain of the exudate shows numerous neutrophils, many that contain intracellular gram-negative diplococci. He has had three similar episodes of urethritis over the past 2 years. Which of the following properties of the infecting organism best explains the reinfection?
Antigenic variation or Catalase or Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function or Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function.","### Answer: Antigenic variation
### Explanation: Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes acute nongonoccocal urethritis (NGU). It can be differentiated from Chlamydia trachomatis by its ability to grow on Thayer-Main medium and by its antigens. Gonorrhea is caused by serovar-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which undergoes frequent changes through mutations in the wzy gene encoding LPS O-polysaccharide transferases. This results in antigenic variations every few months; this accounts for recurrent disease despite immunity. C. trachomatis does not have an analogous mechanism. Catalase production distinguishes N. meningitidis from other pathogenic neisseriae. Neither N. gonorrhoeae nor C. trachomatis produces catalase. Both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis produce proteases that degrade host tissues but do not affect lymphocytes.
Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function is characteristic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function is characteristic of M. leprae.

"A 54-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe jaw pain since undergoing a painful dental procedure 1 day ago. The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?
Decreased absorption of codeine or Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine or Deficiency of κ receptors or Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine.","### Answer: Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine
### Explanation: This patient suffers from an autosomal dominant disorder that results in increased binding of drugs (including opioids like codeine) to serum proteins. As a result, lower concentrations reach tissues, leading to decreased efficacy. Drugs bound tightly to albumin cannot be removed easily; therefore, patients who develop methylxanthines (e.g., theophylline), warfarin, heparin, sulfonamides, penicillins, or lithium intoxication can benefit from drug level monitoring. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia exhibit reduced LDL clearance due to mutated apo B-100. Mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase lead to phenylketonuria. Defective DNA repair leads to xeroderma pigmentosa.
Defective synthesis of α subunits of GABAA receptor complexes causes absence seizures in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
Increased activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes increases the rate of metabolism of codeine to its active form, morphine.
Lack of functional κ receptors would not affect the response to codeine.
Mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme CYP2D6 cause variability in the metabolism of many drugs including codeine.
Patients with defective NMDA receptors suffer from mycotic anemia.
Patients with defective HLA class II genes are susceptible to autoimmune diseases.
Patients with defective tyrosine kinase receptors are prone to developing acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Patients with defective dopaminergic neurons die before birth.
Patients with defective glucokinase are resistant to insulin.
Patients with defective glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptors are resistant to platelet aggregation.
Patients with defective hemoglobin lack oxygen transport capacity.
Patients with defective hexose monophosphate shunt are unable to produce pentoses.
Patients with defective histidine decarboxylase are deficient in histamine production.
Patients with defective hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase are deficient in purine salvage pathway.
Patients with defective lactate dehydrogenase are deficient in pyruvate conversion to lactate.
Patients with defective lipoprotein lipase are deficient in triglyceride breakdown.
Patients with defective mitochondrial DNA polymerase are deficient in base pairing during replication.
Patients with defective muscarinic receptors are resistant to parasympathetic stimulation.
Patients with defective norepinephrine transporters are resistant to sympathetic stimulation.
Patients with defective phosphatidylethanolamina N-methyltransferase are deficient in sperm motility.
Patients with defective phosphofructokinase I are deficient in fructose-1,6-bisphosphate formation.
Patients with defective phosphodiesterase V are deficient in cAMP degradation.
Patients with defective phosphoinositide 3-kinase are deficient in cell survival signaling.
Patients with defective phosphotyrosine phosphatase are deficient in intracellular signaling.
Patients with defective proton pump are deficient in acid secretion.

"A healthy 4-year-old girl is brought for a well-child examination. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Aortic stenosis or Atrial septal defect or Coarctation of the aorta or Mitral valve prolapse.","### Answer: Atrial septal defect
### Explanation: This child has an ASD (patent foramen ovale), which explains both the wide pulmonary artery pressure gradient and the mid-diastolic murmur. In addition to these findings, patients often have a history of recurrent pneumonias during early life. These children usually grow normally but can develop CHF if they become infected with RSV. They also tend to be taller because their lungs overgrow their chest cage. There is little risk of developing systemic hypertension from an ASD alone; however, this complication occurs when there is associated coarctation of the aorta.
The other choices would not produce a wide PAPG.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Acalculous cholecystitis or Chronic relapsing pancreatitis or Diverticulitis of the cecum or Herpes zoster.","### Answer: Herpes zoster
### Explanation: This patient has shingles (herpes zoster), which occurs when varicella virus reactivates many years after initial infection and causes a dermatomal vesicular eruption along an area innervated by a single spinal nerve root. Painful inflammation of the dorsal root ganglion can cause referred pain into the skin overlying the affected dermatome. Inflammatory changes involving the adjacent sympathetic chain can also contribute to the pain. Shingles typically involves only one side of the body; however, it occasionally affects both sides simultaneously. Varicella zoster virus remains latent in sensory ganglia throughout life. Reactivation of this virus usually follows trauma, surgery, stress, immunosuppression, or other conditions that compromise cellular immunity. Patients who have had chickenpox but not experienced subsequent episodes of shingles remain susceptible to future attacks.Diagnosis: Herpes zoster

"A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of acne. Breast and pubic hair development began at the age of 12 years. Menarche occurred at the age of 14 years. Physical examination shows scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead. Breast and pubic hair development are Tanner stage 5. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne?
Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands or Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone or Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands or Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens.","### Answer: Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens
### Explanation: Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease that affects pilosebaceous units. It results from increased production of sebum and keratinization within the ductal epithelium. Androgens increase sebum production through their effect on the sebaceous gland. Estrogen decreases sebum production; therefore, menstruation would not be expected to worsen acne. FSH increases sebum production but only after puberty has begun. Sympathetic stimulation does not play a role in regulating sebum production. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is derived from testosterone, also increases sebum production.
Diagnosis: Acne vulgaris
Information: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Hyperandrogenism + oligoovulation + cystic ovaries
Treatment: Combination oral contraceptives, spironolactone, topical retinoids, minocycline, clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide
Complications: Scarring, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, hidradenitis suppurativa
Key concept: Androgens increase sebum production through their effect on the sebaceous gland.

"A 19-year-old Asian female college student comes to the university health center because of a 1-week history of nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat. Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?
Eustachian tube dysfunction or Mucosal edema or Nasal polyps or Oral contraceptive use.","### Answer: Eustachian tube dysfunction
### Explanation: Acute sinusitis can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites; however, acute sinusitis is usually due to bacterial infection. Viral rhinitis causes inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses that resolves spontaneously within several weeks. Inflammatory changes associated with viral infections include hyperemia, congestion, and increased viscosity of secretions. Fungal sinusitis occurs when there is immunosuppression from corticosteroid therapy, diabetes, cancer chemotherapy, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It presents with chronic symptoms of nasal obstruction, headache, facial pain, fever, and nasal discharge. Parasitic infestation of the nose and sinuses is rare in humans and typically involves Ascaris lumbricoides. This type of infection is seen in children who put their fingers into their noses. Sinonasal mycetoma is a localized granulomatous disease characterized by the presence of pus and grains of fungi in the nasal cavity. It is often caused by Actinomyces species. Allergic rhinitis is a common condition that results from hypersensitivity reactions to environmental antigens. Patients present with itchy watery eyes, nasal congestion, postnasal drip, and sneezing. Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi. It is transmitted through contact with contaminated water. It presents with nasal polyp formation and bleeding. Tumor invasion of the paranasal sinuses is relatively rare. Most tumors arise in the ethmoid sinuses. They cause symptoms similar to those of chronic sinusitis. Diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment consists of surgical removal followed by radiation therapy.
Mucosal edema is unlikely since the patient’s vital signs are normal.
Nasal polyps are unlikely since they are commonly associated with allergic rhinitis.

"A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?
1% or 10% or 40% or 90%.","### Answer: 90%
### Explanation: Statistical power is the probability of detecting an actual difference between groups when it exists. In this case, the probability of wrongly concluding that there is no difference between the two treatments is 1%, which means that the power of the test would be 99%. Power = 1 - b error = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 806
""Power of a Test ""
The term 'power' refers to the ability of a hypothesis test to distinguish between true null hypotheses and false null hypotheses. It is closely related to the significance level chosen beforehand.
In other words, the power of a test determines how often we can expect to reject a null hypothesis when it is actually false.
It is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if the power of a test is 95 percent, then we would expect to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false 95 times out of 100.
If the power of a test is low, then we have less confidence that our results reflect reality; conversely, high power implies greater confidence in the validity of our conclusions.
A common misconception is that increasing sample size increases the power of a test. This is not entirely correct because while larger samples tend to increase precision, their impact on power depends upon the relationship between the sample size and the desired effect size.
For instance, consider a situation where you want to determine the average height of all males living in New York City. If your sample consists of only five individuals, you might find that the mean height is 70 inches. However, if you were able to measure the height of every male resident in New York City, you might discover that the mean height was closer to 68 inches. Thus, even though the second sample has twice the number of observations as the first, its power is lower since the variability within each group is smaller.
This phenomenon is known as the law of large numbers. Specifically, the expected value of the proportion of observations falling above or below a certain point approaches the population parameter as the sample size grows. As long as the sample size is sufficiently large, however, the central limit theorem states that the distribution of the observed proportions approximates normality.
Thus, the power of a test is determined primarily by the ratio of the variance within versus the variance among groups.
To illustrate these concepts further, let us assume that we wish to compare the effects of two different diets on weight loss. We recruit 10 subjects who follow a low-carbohydrate diet and another 10 subjects who follow a low-fat diet over the course of six months. At the end of the experiment, we calculate the mean weight lost per subject for both groups. Assuming that the variances within each group are equal, the power of this test is approximately 80 percent assuming a type I error rate of 5 percent.
However, suppose that we had decided to enroll 20 subjects into each arm of the study. Since the sample sizes are now much larger, the power of the test would rise to nearly 99 percent!
Of course, conducting experiments with thousands of subjects is generally impractical. Therefore, researchers must carefully balance the tradeoff between sample size and experimental duration.
Furthermore, the choice of alpha level also affects the power of a test. Generally speaking, decreasing the alpha level from 0.05 to 0.01 requires fourfold larger sample sizes to achieve equivalent power.
Finally, note that power does not refer specifically to the probability of accepting the null hypothesis. Rather, it measures the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.
Therefore, the power of a test is independent of the direction of the alternative hypothesis.
That being said, the power of a test is strongly correlated with the effect size of interest.
Specifically, the power of a test tends to decrease rapidly as the effect size falls below 0.5.
Conversely, the power of a test tends to approach infinity as the effect size becomes arbitrarily large.
As a result, many statisticians recommend using Cohen's guidelines for interpreting the practical significance of effect sizes.
Coefficients of Determination
Another important concept in statistics is coefficient of determination. Coefficient of determination is used to describe the strength of association between two variables.
More formally, the coefficient of determination represents the fraction of variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable.
When analyzing data, it is useful to know how well the model fits the data. One way to quantify this fit is through",90%
"A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of progressive fatigue and ankle swelling. He had an anterior myocardial infarction 3 years ago and has had shortness of breath with mild exertion since then. Current medications include labetalol and daily aspirin. He has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 100/min and regular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. There are jugular venous pulsations 5 cm above the sternal angle. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. There is edema from the midtibia to the ankle bilaterally. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or Impaired contractility of the left ventricle or Prolapse of the mitral valve or Thrombosis of the superior vena cava.","### Answer: Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
### Explanation: This patient has congestive heart failure (CHF). CHF can be caused by impairment of cardiac function, increased peripheral resistance, or decreased compliance of the ventricles. Increased hydrostatic pressures within the veins lead to interstitial fluid accumulation and edema. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure reflects right atrial pressure; therefore, it would decrease if there were no obstruction to flow through the lungs. Diastolic dysfunction leads to impaired relaxation of the left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction. Mitral regurgitation occurs when the mitral valve prolapses into the left atrium during systole. Superior vena caval thrombosis causes headache, nausea, vomiting, and neck pain. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from chronically elevated pulmonary arterial pressures.
Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure

\end{code}
\end{quote}

Answer: Option A - Decreased PCWP

The question is asking about the cause of congestive heart failure.
Causes of congestive heart failure

Impaired cardiac contraction
Increased peripheral resistance
Decreased compliance of the ventricles

Now we have to choose among these options.
Option B - Impaired cardiac contraction
This option is ruled out because diastolic dysfunction leads to impaired relaxation of the left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction.
Option C - Decreased compliance of the ventricles
This option is also ruled out because compliance refers to the ability of the ventricles to stretch. It cannot explain the development of congestive heart failure.
Option E - Right ventricular hypertrophy
Right ventricular hypertrophy results from chronically elevated pulmonary arterial pressures. But how does it result in congestive heart failure?
So, the best answer here is option 'A'.
PCWP is decreased due to backward filtration of plasma into the systemic circulation.
""Backward filtration of plasma into the systemic circulation reduces the volume of plasma available for filtration across the alveolar capillaries, thereby reducing the PCWP.""
—Harrison
Note that PCWP is not measured invasively but rather estimated indirectly using the formulae provided below.

"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks. She has not had fever or weight loss. She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?
Decreased plasma renin activity or Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations or Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations or Increased serum bradykinin concentrations.","### Answer: Increased serum bradykinin concentrations
### Explanation: Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that blocks conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This results in decreased formation of vasoconstricting angiotensin II and increased levels of vasodilator bradykinin. Bradykinin stimulates cough receptors on bronchial epithelium. Patients taking ACE inhibitors often develop dry cough within several days after initiation of therapy. Clinical features include irritability, dyspnea, wheezing, and paroxysmal cough. These symptoms usually resolve spontaneously but can be severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. Diuretics decrease plasma renin activity; therefore, they would have little effect on angiotensin II production. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor that increases prorenin and reduces angiotensinogen levels. It would increase rather than reduce angiotensin II levels. Losartan is an AT1 antagonist that binds to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. It would block the effects of angiotensin II rather than increasing its concentration. Captopril is another ACE inhibitor that also increases bradykinin levels.
Diagnosis: Dry cough due to ACE inhibitor use
Drug: Enalapril
Therapeutic response: Discontinue drug

Text: “ACE inhibitors act by blocking the generation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I.”
“Angiotensin II acts through the AT1 receptor to cause constriction of arterioles and release of aldosterone”
Figure 10-10. Effects of ACE inhibition on circulatory system.
Key Concept:
ACE inhibitors result in decreased synthesis of angiotensin II which leads to relaxation of arteriolar smooth muscle via AT1 receptor.
This causes hypotension and activation of baroreceptors leading to reflex tachycardia.
In addition, there is increased secretion of bradykinin resulting in cough.
Bradykinin also dilates vessels and relaxes airways.
The net effect is vasodilation and bronchodilation.

She says that his teachers reprimand him frequently for running wildly in the classroom, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat; he often forgets to turn in his homework. His parents are currently divorcing. His father has a history of illicit drug use. The patient is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a dislocated left shoulder, healing abrasions over the elbows, and ecchymoses in various stages of healing over the knees. Mental status examination shows a neutral affect. He says that he likes to run and climb trees. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or Conduct disorder or Learning disorder or Seizure disorder.","### Answer: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
### Explanation: This child has attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). ADHD is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Children with ADHD have difficulty focusing on tasks, paying attention to details, sitting still, waiting their turns, controlling their behavior, and following instructions. They also tend to be very curious and like to explore their environment. In addition, they can be easily distracted by external stimuli and have trouble concentrating. Hyperactivity manifests itself through restlessness, fidgety movements, and an inability to sit still. Impulsiveness results from poor self-control and lack of planning ahead. These children usually require special education programs and psychotherapy. Medications used include methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and atomoxetine.
Conduct disorder is characterized by persistent violation of social norms and expectations, including aggression towards people and animals, destruction of property, deceiving others, stealing, and skipping school. It typically begins before age 18 years and lasts longer than 6 months. Treatment includes individual therapy, family therapy, and medications if necessary.
Learning disorders refer to difficulties learning specific academic skills despite adequate educational resources. Dyslexia refers to reading problems, dyscalculia refers to math problems, and dysgraphia refers to writing problems.
Seizures can cause unprovoked falls, but not the other behaviors described herein.
Schizophrenia is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder, flat or blunted emotional expression, and social withdrawal. Onset occurs between ages 15 and 40 years.
Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by impaired communication, language development, and social interaction. There is repetitive behavior and interests.

"A 49-year-old man, who is recovering in the hospital 2 days after uncomplicated left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting for claudication, has now developed increasing pain in his left foot. Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?
Bedside compartment pressure measurements or Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity or Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy or Intraoperative angiography.","### Answer: Bedside compartment pressure measurements
### Explanation: This patient has acute limb ischemia due to an occlusive vascular event that occurred during recovery from femoropopliteal bypass surgery. He presents with symptoms consistent with peripheral arterial embolism. Although this complication can be life threatening, it usually resolves spontaneously within hours if not minutes. However, prompt recognition and treatment are essential because the mortality rate approaches 70% when there is no intervention. If the clinician suspects PE, then bedside measurement of compartment pressures is indicated. Compartment syndrome occurs when increased intracompartmental pressure exceeds the perfusion pressure of the muscle beds. It results in decreased venous outflow and impaired aerial inflow. When the pressure increases above the critical level, irreversible damage ensues. Diagnosis is made by measuring the pressure difference between the systolic pressure distal to the site of obstruction and the diastolic pressure proximal to the site of obstruction. If the pressure gradient is greater than 50 mmHg, then PE is likely. Doppler ultrasound would not provide sufficient information to diagnose PE. Intravenous thrombolysis is contraindicated in patients with active bleeding or recent trauma. Intraoperative revascularization is unnecessary since the condition is expected to resolve rapidly.
Diagnostic Procedures
The gold standard for establishing the presence of PE is direct visualization of the affected vessel using either conventional angiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Conventional angiographic techniques have several limitations including invasiveness, high cost, and radiation exposure. MRI does not require catheter insertion but requires specialized equipment and expertise. Therefore, these tests are generally reserved for cases where other methods fail to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
In addition to maintaining adequate oxygen delivery through supplemental oxygen administration, the mainstay of treatment consists of restoring flow into the compromised area. This can be achieved by administering vasodilators, which increase collateral circulation, or by performing emergent endovascular procedures. Vasodilation can be accomplished by infusing nitrogen oxide donors like glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) or hydralazine. These agents dilate both systemic and splanchnic vessels, thereby improving overall cardiac performance and reducing preload. Endovascular procedures include balloon angioplasty, stent placement, and thromboaspiration. Balloon angioplasty involves inflating a small balloon across the lesion to restore patency. Stents are placed across the lesion to prevent recurrent narrowing. Thromboaspiration uses a large bore needle inserted percutaneously over the groin to aspirate clots from the affected vessel.
Complications
PE is associated with significant morbidity and moality rates approaching 70%. Complications include myonecrosis, gangrene, amputation, renal failure, and death. Myonecrosis is caused by prolonged ischemia resulting in coagulation necrosis of skeletal muscles. Gangrene develops secondary to ischemia leading to edema formation followed by skin sloughing. Amputations occur when gangrenous changes progress beyond salvageability. Renal failure is common among those with severe hypotension. Death typically occurs within 24 hrs of onset of symptoms.
Conclusion
Peripheral embolism is a potentially lethal disease process characterized by sudden loss of blood supply to the lower extremities. Prompt identification and aggressive management are necessary to avoid serious consequences. While noninvasive modalities like duplex scanning and CT scan can aid in making the diagnosis, they cannot replace definitive diagnosis via conventional angiography or MRI. Treatment options range from conservative measures like supplemental oxygen and vasodilatory drugs to minimally invasive endovascular procedures like balloon angioplasty and thromboaspiration. Despite advances in medical technology, the prognosis remains poor with up to 70% mortality.

"A 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive weakness and a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids over the past 8 weeks. His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry, scaly patches of the skin. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9 months ago. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Dermatomyositis or Duchenne's muscular dystrophy or Eczema or Lyme disease.","### Answer: Dermatomyositis
### Explanation: This patient has dermatomyositis, an inflammatory myopathy characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness, skin changes, and elevated serum levels of creatine kinase. In children, it usually presents as a systemic illness with fever, malaise, arthralgias, and a characteristic facial rash. It also commonly involves the knee and elbow joints. The rash typically begins as pinkish maculopapular lesions that evolve into violaceous papules and then become hyperpigmented. Skin involvement occurs in up to 40% of patients with juvenile dermatomyositis. Treatment includes glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, physical therapy, and sometimes azathioprine or methotrexate. Muscular dystrophies present with hypotonia and weakness beginning between ages 2 and 5 years. They have a poor prognosis. Eczema does not cause proximal muscle weakness. Lyme disease causes a localized annular rash with central clearing and a few days later, a migratory polyneuritis. Polymyalgia rheumatica is associated with giant cell arteritis and results in painful shoulder girdle syndrome. Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease that leads to sclerosis of the skin, visceral organs, and vessels.

Nodes are palpated in the inguinal and femoral areas. A smear of fluid from the lesions establishes the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?
Chlamydia trachomatis or Haemophilus ducreyi or Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Streptococcus pyogenes (group A).","### Answer: Chlamydia trachomatis
### Explanation: Genital herpes caused by HSV-2 can be acquired either through sexual contact or neonatally during passage through an infected birth canal. Infection with C trachomatis serovars D to K causes genital chlamydiosis; these strains account for approximately half of all cases of PID. These strains also cause cervicitis, endometritis, salpingitis, epididymitis, proctitis, urethritis, and pharyngitis. Serovars L1, L2, and L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum, which presents as tender regional lymphadenopathy. Serovar E causes inclusion conjunctivitis. Serovars A, B, Ba, and C cause trachoma, while serovars I and J cause infantile inclusion conjuctivitis.
Haemophilus ducreyi does not cause genital disease. Gonorrhea usually produces no local inflammation but rather a purulent discharge. Syphilis would produce primary chancre on the external genitalia. Group A streptococcal infections tend to occur in children and involve the skin and soft tissues.

Doxorubicin or Fluorouracil or Methotrexate or Vincristine.","### Answer: Vincristine
### Explanation: Peripheral neuropathy can occur after administration of vincristine (choice D). This drug acts on microtubules during mitosis and causes cell death. It has been used primarily in treatment of acute leukemia but also in Hodgkin disease and Wilms tumors. Doxorubicin (choice A), fluorouracil (choice B), methotrexate (choice C), and cisplatin (choice E) have not been associated with peripheral neuropathy.
Diagnosis: Acute peripheral neuropathy
Learning Objectives:

Vincristine is an anticancer drug that affects tubulin polymerization and leads to formation of abnormal microtubule structures.
The primary mechanism of action of vincristine involves binding to tubulin dimers and preventing their assembly into microtubules.
Vincristine is administered parenterally; it is rapidly metabolized by liver and excreted unchanged in urine.
Vincristine is indicated for use in combination regimens for the treatment of acute childhood leukemias, including ALL and AML.
It is also effective against Burkitt’s lymphoma and Wilm’s tumor.
Adverse reactions include bone marrow suppression, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, myelosuppression, and peripheral neuropathy.
Peripheral neuropathy occurs due to damage to axons and is characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias, painful sensations, motor neuron degeneration, and muscle wasting.
Neurotoxic side effect of vinca alkaloids is related to its ability to bind to tubulin dimers and prevent their assembly into microtubules.
In addition, vincristine interferes with axonal transport of proteins essential for normal functioning of neurons.

24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring or Multiple sleep latency test or Polysomnography or CT scan of the head.","### Answer: Perform hemoglobin A1c measurement
### Explanction: This patient has diabetes mellitus type 2. Diagnosing diabetes requires demonstrating persistent hyperglycemia (fasting plasma glucose >126 mg/dL or random plasma glucose >200 mg/dL). The American Diabetic Association recommends screening asymptomatic adults older than age 45 years every 3 years unless they have evidence of impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. Screening should begin earlier in individuals with high-risk factors, including obesity, family history of diabetes, or ethnic group predisposition. Once diabetes is confirmed, annual assessment of glycemic control using hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurements is recommended. If the HbA1c value exceeds the goal range, then additional tests are required to evaluate the cause of poor glycemic control. These include urine testing for ketones, renal function tests, lipid profile, thyroid stimulating hormone, C-peptide, and antibodies against pancreatic islets. Insulin therapy is initiated only if all other causes of hyperglycemia are ruled out and if the HbA1c remains above the goal range despite optimal lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy. Metformin is used first line in noninsulin dependent diabetics.

An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Acute myocardial infarction or Aortic dissection or Esophageal rupture or Mitral valve prolapse.","### Answer: Acute myocardial infarction
### Explanation: This patient had an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which was complicated by cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade can occur from any cause that results in accumulation of fluid within the pericardium. In this case, it resulted from hemorrhagic pericarditis secondary to transmural myocardial necrosis. Patients present with hypotension, tachycardia, and jugular venous distention. Electrical alternans is seen on electrocardiography. Emergent pericardiocentesis is indicated if there is evidence of impending cardiac arrest.
Aortic dissections usually have a tearing character to them; however, they can be silent. They typically involve the ascending aorta and arch. These patients often have a history of hypertension.
Esophageal ruptures result in mediastinal emphysema and air under the diaphragm. There would not be significant pericardial effusion.
Mitral valve prolapse is associated with mitral regurgitation but does not lead to tamponade.
Pulmonary embolism causes pleural effusions rather than pericardial effusions.

"A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for her first influenza virus vaccination. She has a history of untreated hypertension. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Shortly after administration of the influenza virus vaccine, she develops shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this reaction?
Inquiry about an egg allergy or Heterophile agglutination test or Skin test with histamine reagent or β-Adrenergic blocking agent therapy.","### Answer: Inquiry about an egg allergy
### Explanation: Egg protein contaminates many commercial preparations used in immunizations (e.g., influenza viral vaccines). Patients who experience severe allergic reactions to eggs can be treated prophylactically before receiving these vaccines. This patient would not have developed any symptoms if her health care provider had asked about an egg allergy during preimmunization screening. Administration of heterologous antigens (i.e., tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid) does not cause immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Histamine skin testing is performed on patients suspected of having IgE-mediated food allergies. β-Adrenergic blockade could potentially reduce the severity of anaphylactic shock but cannot prevent it from occurring. Corticosteroids also cannot prevent anaphylaxis; however, they can decrease its severity.

Subsection i. Type I Hypersensitivity Reaction

Page no: 138
Table 4-10

Key Concept:
Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated type I hypersensitivity reactions occur within minutes to hours after exposure to specific antigens.
These reactions involve mast cells and basophils that release mediators responsible for the clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis.
The primary treatment for anaphylaxis is epinephrine administered via intramuscular injection.
Antihistamines and corticosteroid medications provide only palliative relief.

"A 42-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis comes to the office because she had a sudden loss of vision in the right eye. She has no history of diplopia. External ocular movements are normal but funduscopic examination shows pallor of the optic disk. This patient's condition is most likely a result of demyelination of which of the following?
Medial longitudinal fasciculus or Oculomotor nerve or Optic nerve or Trigeminal nerve.","### Answer: Optic nerve
### Explanation: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects myelinated axons throughout the CNS. It can cause visual symptoms due to inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerves. Demyelination results in decreased conduction velocity through the affected fibers, leading to slowing of transmission along the pathway. In this case, there was a decrease in blood flow to the retina, resulting in pallor of the optic disk. Diplopia would be seen if both eyes were involved. Medial longitudinal fasciculus carries information from the cerebral cortex to the thalamus; damage to it could lead to contralateral hemiplegia. Oculomotor nerve innervates extraocular muscles; lesions here would produce paralysis of these muscles. Trigeminal nerve supplies sensory innervation to the face; lesions here would not have any effect on the visual system. Visual pathways include the optic nerve, lateral geniculate nucleus, optic radiations, and occipital lobe. Lesions anywhere within this pathway can cause visual field defects.

"A previously healthy 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Menarche was at the age of 12 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses a combination contraceptive patch. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally. Pelvic examination shows a purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 13,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 345,000/mm3 . A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Oral azithromycin or Vaginal clindamycin or Intravenous penicillin and vancomycin or Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline.","### Answer: Oral azithromycin
### Explanation: This patient has pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Pregnancy testing is not necessary since she is using effective birth control. Azithromycin is an alternative regimen that can be used if the patient cannot tolerate ciprofloxacin due to side effects or allergies. Clindamycin is also acceptable but requires higher doses. Ceftriaxone plus doxycycline would require hospitalization. Cefotetan plus gentamicin would have similar efficacy but would require longer treatment courses.
About other options:
Vancomycin is indicated only when MRSA is suspected.
Clindamycin is contraindicated during lactation.
Doxycycline is contraindicated during pregnancy.
Metronidazole is associated with peripheral neuropathy.
TMP-SMX is associated with hepatitis.
Erythromycin estolate is associated with hypersensitivity reactions.

Key Concept:

"A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of an 8-hour history of severe back and abdominal pain and mild but persistent vaginal bleeding. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows a 2-cm ectopic pregnancy in the ampulla. The ampulla has ruptured into the surrounding tissue. Fluid from this rupture will most likely be found in which of the following locations?
Lesser peritoneal cavity or Mesometrium or Pouch of Douglas or Uterine cavity.","### Answer: Lesser peritoneal cavity
### Explanation: In the case described, the patient had a tubal (ectopic) pregnancy that ruptured into the lesser sac. This would result in free fluid within the lesser sac. The mesometrium is the layer of peritoneum between the ovary and uterus; it does not communicate with any other space. The pouch of Douglas lies below the uterus and communicates with the rectouterine recess. The fallopian tubes lie on either side of the uterus and open into the uterine cavity.

"A 36-year-old female advertising executive is referred to the office for evaluation of a fasting serum total cholesterol concentration of 249 mg/dL. She has a family history of early coronary artery disease (CAD) and her father died suddenly at age 46 years of myocardial infarction. She tells you that she has never had chest pain. She is not currently sexually active and has no children. She claims that her high-stress lifestyle makes it impossible for her to eat regular meals or to follow a special diet, and she usually eats fast food. She exercises two or three times a week for about 20 minutes on a treadmill. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Her only medication is acetaminophen for tension headaches. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 76 kg (167 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs today are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities except for mild obesity. Institution of which of the following is the most essential step in the prevention of CAD in this patient?
Biofeedback-based stress reduction program or More rigorous and consistent exercise program or Smoking cessation program or Strict low-calorie diet.","### Answer: Smoking cessation program
### Explanation: This woman needs to quit smoking immediately. Although there is evidence that lowering LDL levels reduces cardiovascular risk, the best way to reduce risk is to stop smoking. In addition, weight loss would be beneficial but is unlikely to occur if she continues to smoke. Biofeedback training can help control blood pressure, but it does not affect lipid concentrations. Diet modification alone is insufficient; however, when combined with increased physical activity, it can have an effect on both lipids and blood pressure.

"A 39-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, comes to the community-based health center because of a 6-month history of a copious, foul-smelling vaginal discharge. She also reports spotting that began 6 months ago and has progressed to heavy bleeding during the past 3 weeks. Medical history is significant for an abnormal Pap smear in her 20s; her most recent Pap smear was done 12 years ago during her second pregnancy, and she recalls the results as being normal. She takes no medications. The patient was married for 18 years; her husband died 4 years ago and had undergone vasectomy after the birth of their last child.

Which of the following is the most critical factor in formulating a management plan for this patient?
Hypertension or Obesity or Patient age or Stage of disease.","### Answer: Hypertension
### Explanation: This patient has stage IA endometrial cancer. Endometrial carcinoma is associated with obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperestrogenism. In addition, patients who have never been screened for cervical cancer are at increased risk for developing endometrial cancer. Although the patient does not meet criteria for surgery urgency, it would be reasonable to perform a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy if possible. If the tumor extends beyond the uterine cavity, then radiation therapy can be used. Chemotherapy is rarely indicated unless there is metastatic spread.
The patient’s weight is not a contributing factor to the development of endometrial cancer. However, morbid obesity increases the risk of postoperative complications.
Patients with endometrial cancer typically present with postmenopausal bleeding.
This patient’s age is not a risk factor for endometrial cancer.
There is no evidence that the patient’s Pap test result was abnormal.

"A 43-year-old female presents to the office with a 2-month history of heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, and diffuse goiter. Examination reveals exophthalmos, inflammation of the periorbital tissue and conjunctivae, a heart rate of 140/min, and warm, velvety skin. An MRI of the head and orbits will most likely reveal
calcification of the orbit or diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles or dilated ventricles or lymphoma.","### Answer: calcification of the orbit
### Explanation: Graves disease (diffuse thyrotoxicosis), an autoimmune disorder characterized by hyperthyroidism due to antibodies that stimulate TSH receptors on thyroid follicular cells, can be associated with ophthalmopathy, dermopathy, and pretibial myxedema. Ocular involvement occurs in up to 5% of patients and consists of lid retraction, proptosis, corneal ulcerations, and optic neuritis. Dermopathy manifests as thickening of the skin of the shins and feet; it is caused by deposition of glycosaminoglycans in collagen fibers. Pretibial myxedema results from edema of the subcutaneous connective tissues of the lower legs and is accompanied by nonpitting edema. Orbitopathy is usually mild but occasionally causes blindness. Treatment includes administration of glucocorticoids, radioactive iodine therapy, surgery, and plasmapheresis.
Calcifications occur in approximately 10% of cases and consist of small foci within the fatty tissue of the retrobulbar area. They appear as well-defined round masses with sharp margins and low density on CT scanning. Calcifications are not specific for Graves disease because they also occur in other endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency, Cushing syndrome, and acromegaly.
Diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles would suggest pseudotumor cerebri, which is seen in children and young adults. It is characterized by papilledema, visual disturbances, headache, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, and abducens palsy.
Dilated ventricles would indicate hydrocephalus, which is defined as increased CSF production plus obstruction of its flow through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie. Hydrocephalus can cause symptoms similar to those described above.
Lymphoma is a neoplasm composed of B or T lymphocytes and histiocytes. Involvement of the orbit produces swelling of the eyelid, chemosedimentation of the eye, pain, photophobia, and impairment of vision.

"A 64-year-old male presents to the emergency room with a bloody nose that has been dripping out his nares for the past 2 hours. He denies any trauma, recent upper respiratory illness, or history of prior bloody nose. Past medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has a blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg. Examination of the nasal passages reveals that the site of the bleeding is on the septal mucosa of the right naris. The most appropriate next step in management includes
anterior packing or placing an ice compress over the nose or catheter balloon tamponade or pinching the nares together for 5 minutes.","### Answer: anterior packing
### Explanation: (Braunwald, pp 170-171; CSDT, p 515.) This patient’s condition can be managed either conservatively or surgically. Conservative measures include applying ice compresses, topical vasoconstrictors, and digital pressure to the nose. These maneuvers often stop the bleeding but have limited success when used alone. Surgical intervention involves ligating the artery proximal to its point of entry into the nasal cavity. In this case, the internal maxillary artery would need to be ligated because it enters the nasal cavity through the sphenopalatine foramen. Alternatively, if the source of bleeding were from the little’s area, then the external carotid artery could be ligated. If these procedures cannot be performed immediately, then anterior packing can be done until definitive treatment can be accomplished. Posterior packing is not recommended because it increases intracranial pressure.
Option B: Ice compresses are useful in treating acute epistaxis. However, they are not effective enough to warrant their use as the first line therapy.
Option C: Balloon tamponades are rarely indicated in patients who present with severe hemorrhage. They are usually reserved for those patients whose life expectancy is less than 2 weeks.
Option D: Pinching the nostrils closed does nothing to control the bleeding vessel itself. It only causes the blood to pool in other areas of the face.

These blisters are most likely the result of adhesion failure involving which of the following?
Basement membrane or Dermal papillae or Langerhans cells or Melanocytes.","### Answer: Basement membrane
### Explanation: (a) Source: (Kasper, p. 1968)The patient has bullous impetigo, an uncommon disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It occurs primarily in adults who have normal skin immunity but lack mucosal immunity. Infection begins on mucosa, spreading via lymphatics to involve the epidermis. Adherence of basement membranes depends upon desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and anchoring filaments. Desmosomes link keratin intermediate filaments to actin microfilaments; they also connect adjacent keratinocytes through cadherins. Hemidesmosomes attach the basement membrane to the cell surface via integrins. Anchoring filaments include laminin, entactin, and tenascin.

Examination shows anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis bilaterally, a strawberry tongue, an erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of this illness?
Intravenous immune globulin or Intravenous penicillin or Intravenous prednisone or Oral isoniazid.","### Answer: Intravenous immune globulin
### Explanation: This patient has Kawasaki disease, which can be complicated by coronary artery aneurysms that lead to myocardial infarction. IVIG reduces the incidence of these vascular complications. Penicillin would not treat the underlying cause of the vasculitis; it might reduce secondary bacteremia from skin lesions. Corticosteroids have been used but are less effective than IVIG. Isoniazid prophylaxis against tuberculosis is indicated only if there is evidence of latent TB.

"A 40-year-old female secretary comes to the office because of a 2-month history of fatigue, and generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. The patient initially noticed the weakness only while she was getting in and out of her car, but during the past 2 weeks, the weakness has progressed, so that she now has difficulty combing her hair. Since the symptoms began, she also has had aching of the joints in her hands that has responded partially to ibuprofen. She was adopted and family history is unknown. She has two teenaged children who are well. She appears uncomfortable. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 68 kg(150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.7°C (99.8°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination discloses cracking of the skin of both hands that involves the tips and lateral sides of several fingers. The muscles of the upper arms and legs are somewhat tender to pressure. Results of serum laboratory studies show a creatine kinase concentration of 600 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 800 U/L. Results of complete blood count are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Fibromyalgia or Myasthenia gravis or Polymyositis or Scleroderma.","### Answer: Polymyositis
### Explanation: This woman has polymyositis, an inflammatory disease characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness. It occurs primarily in middle age and affects women twice as often as men. Fatigue and myalgia precede the development of weakness. Weakness usually begins in the neck and shoulder girdle and then spreads to involve other parts of the body. Involvement of the extraocular muscles can result in diplopia. There is no specific treatment; corticosteroids improve symptoms in many patients. Fibromyalgia is not associated with elevated CK levels. Myasthenia gravis causes fluctuating weakness of the facial and limb muscles. Scleroderma is a systemic autoimmune disease that produces fibrosis of the skin, lung, kidney, esophagus, and heart. Raynaud phenomenon is characteristic.
Diagnosis: Polymyositis
""Polymyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of skeletal muscle that presents clinically as symmetrical proximal muscle weakness.""
""The onset of symptoms typically is insidious, with gradual progression over months. Patients complain of fatigability, stiffness, and painful range of motion. Muscular tenderness is common. As the illness evolves, there is increasing weakness of the proximal musculature, particularly of the shoulders, hips, thighs, and neck. Weakness of the pharyngeal and extraocular muscles may occur late in the course of the disease.""
""In contrast to dermatomyositis, which predominantly affects juveniles and young adults, polymyositis tends to be seen in older persons.""
""Most cases of polymyositis resolve spontaneously after several years, although relapses may occur. Some patients have persistent mild weakness despite adequate therapy.""

"A 16-year-old male is brought to the emergency department with sudden-onset swelling of the right knee. He denies any trauma. Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis. Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted. Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution. Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month. The most likely explanation for these findings is
acquired factor VIII deficiency or diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection or hypocomplementemia or malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K.","### Answer: acquired factor VIII deficiency
### Explanation: Hemophilia A (classical hemophilia), an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding factor VIII, results in decreased levels of this clotting protein. This leads to prolonged PT and PTT times, which can be corrected by infusion of recombinant factor VIII. In addition to spontaneous musculoskeletal hemorrhage, patients often have easy bruising and bleeding from the gums. Bleeding into soft tissues can lead to ecchymoses that resolve slowly because they lack sufficient platelets to promote healing. Patients with severe disease may develop hematomas after minor trauma.
Diffuse intravascular coagulation occurs when there is widespread activation of the intrinsic pathway. It usually accompanies major surgery, massive trauma, or sepsis. Although it has been described in association with acute promyelocytic leukemia, it does not result from acquired factor VIII deficiency.
Hypocomplementemic uremic vasculopathy is characterized by thrombosis and necrosis of small blood vessels throughout the body. It is seen primarily in patients receiving long-term dialysis for renal failure. Hypocomplementemia is associated with deposition of immune complexes within vessel walls.
Malabsorption of vitamin K-dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X causes hemorrhages similar to those seen in hemophilia. However, unlike hemophilic patients, who typically present with spontaneous musculoskeletal hemorrhage, patients with vitamin K deficiency tend to experience postoperative hemorrhage.
Acquired von Willebrand’s disease is a rare condition resulting from loss of large multimers of vWF. It presents like classic hemophilia A, although the PTT is normal rather than prolonged.
DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital defect involving T cell development. It is associated with hypocalcemia,","malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K"
"A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?
Frequent turning or Use of wet to dry dressings or Whirlpool therapy or Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.","### Answer: Frequent turning
### Explanation: This patient has decubitus ulcer due to prolonged bed rest and immobility. It can be prevented by frequent turning of the patient every two hours. Antibiotics have no role in its management.
Option B: Wet to dry dressing is used in burn wound not decubitus ulcers.
Option C: Whirlpool bath is contraindicated in patients with open wounds.
Option D: Broad spectrum antibiotics are indicated only when there is an underlying bacterial infection.
Infectious diseases caused by altered host defense mechanisms include tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis, candidiasis, herpes simplex virus infections, human papillomavirus infections, and cytomegalovirus infections.
Treponematoses are chronic infectious diseases that involve various organs and systems. Syphilitic meningitis occurs in late congenital syphilis; it usually presents between ages 4 and 7 years. In adults, neurosyphilis typically involves the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis is rare but may occur during primary or secondary syphilis.
Primary syphilis is characterized by a single chancre, which heals within several weeks after the initial inoculation of Treponema pallidum into the skin. Secondary syphilis develops approximately 6 to 12 weeks later and is marked by a generalized maculopapular rash, malaise, fever, arthralgias, myalgias, and lymphadenopathy.
Late complications of untreated syphilis include cardiac valvular disease, gummatous inflammation, tabes dorsalis, and neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis may cause parenchymal involvement, leading to dementia, seizures, and stroke. Tabes dorsalis causes painful sensory neuropathies, resulting from demyelination of peripheral nerves.
Diagnosis is made by serology using fluorescent treponemal antigen absorption tests (FTAs). FTA-ABS titers >1 : 64 indicate active syphilis, while titers <1 : 64 suggest past exposure.
The mainstay of treatment is penicillin G administered intramuscularly once daily for 2 weeks followed by probenecid to enhance penicillin uptake into the CSF. For allergic reactions, benzathine penicillin G is preferred because it is less likely to induce hypersensitivity reactions.
Penicillins cross the placenta and are excreted in breast milk. Pregnant women must receive appropriate dosages of penicillin G to avoid fetal transmission of syphilis. Breastfeeding mothers should discontinue breastfeeding until they complete their course of antibiotic therapy.
Patients with severe allergic reactions require desensitization before receiving penicillin G. Desensitization consists of gradually increasing the amount of penicillin G administered each day. If the patient experiences a reaction, the next injection is reduced by half. After 2 days of desensitization, full therapeutic dosage is initiated.
Doxycycline is recommended if the patient cannot tolerate penicillin G. Doxycycline is also used in pregnant women and lactating females.
Early latent syphilis is treated with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Late latent syphilis requires longer courses of penicillin G. Patients with neurosyphilis require IV administration of penicillin G.
HIV-positive individuals with neurosyphilis require combination therapy with parenteral ceftriaxone plus oral azithromycin for 2 weeks.

Parenteral penicillin G is the mainstay of therapy for syphilis. It can be administered by IM or intravenous routes. For patients with allergy to penicillin, doxycycline may be used.

"A 25-year-old woman who is 19 weeks pregnant comes to the office for a prenatal examination. Her father had classic hemophilia. A karyotype obtained from an amniotic fluid sample of the patient shows that the fetus is XY. Which of the following should you tell the patient regarding her infant?
The infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier or The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia or The infant has a 50% risk for being a carrier or The infant has a 75% risk for hemophilia.","### Answer: The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia
### Explanation: In males (XY), there is no chance of having hemophilia because they inherit only the Y chromosome and not the X chromosome carrying the gene mutation. Females can either transmit the abnormal allele to their sons (who would then develop hemophilia) or daughters (who would become carriers). Therefore, if both parents carry the disease, each child has a 25% chance of developing it; two children out of three will be carriers. If only the mother is affected, all offspring will be female carriers. If the father is also affected, half of the male offspring will be affected, while the other half will be carriers. Thus, this patient’s son has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease, but her daughter does not.

"A 20-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting. She says that today she noticed a slight amount of blood in her vomit. She is a pre-med college student and admits to being under a lot of stress as she takes final exams. She also says that she drinks a large amount of coffee daily. Vital signs are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial test to order?
abdominal flat plate radiography or amylase level or complete blood count or urine pregnancy test.","### Answer: abdominal flat plate radiography
### Explanation: This patient has an esophageal tear from retching (Mallory Weiss syndrome). It can be diagnosed on plain film x-rays. If not treated promptly, it can lead to perforated ulcer.
The other tests listed would not aid in making this diagnosis.
Amylase levels could help identify pancreatitis but would not show an esophageal tear.
Urinary pregnancy testing would only be relevant if the patient was pregnant.
Complete blood counts would not reveal any information regarding an esophageal tear.
An upper endoscopy would confirm the presence of an esophageal tear; however, it is not indicated initially because of its invasive nature.
Esophagogram would demonstrate air within the mediastinum indicating pneumomediastinum secondary to an esophageal rupture.
Barium swallow would demonstrate the location of the lesion.
CT scan would provide better visualization of the mediastinum compared to chest radiographs.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) would allow dye injection into the biliary tree and pancreatic duct system.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would provide excellent soft tissue resolution of the mediastinum.
Plain films of the chest would not show the extent of the hematoma.
Chest CT scans would provide superior visualization of the thoracic cavity including the mediastinum.
Thoracotomy would allow direct inspection of the mediastinum.
Angiogram would allow identification of vascular injuries.
ECG would evaluate cardiac function.
Laparoscopy would allow examination of the pelvic organs.
Fluorescein angiography would allow assessment of retinal perfusion.
Intravenous pyelogram would allow visualization of the renal collecting systems.
Positron emission tomography (PET) would allow detection of metabolically active cells.

"A 60-year-old man had a total thyroidectomy and excision of enlarged left jugular lymph nodes for follicular carcinoma. The operation was uncomplicated. He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are temperature 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor. Extremities are warm, with brisk capillary refill time. Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following?
Babinski sign present bilaterally or Chvostek sign or Deviation of the tongue to the left side or A drooping left shoulder.","### Answer: Chvostek sign

"In a cohort study of elderly women, the relative risk ratio for hip fractures among those who exercise regularly is 1.2 (95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8). Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture?
Statistically nonsignificant increase in risk or Statistically nonsignificant overall decrease in risk or Statistically significant overall decrease in risk or Statistically significant overall increase in risk.","### Answer: Statistically significant overall decrease in risk
### Explanation: A relative risk of 1.2 indicates that there is an approximately 20% increased risk for hip fractures associated with not exercising compared with exercising. This difference is statistically significant because it falls outside the 95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8. Therefore, we can conclude that regular exercise decreases the risk for hip fractures.
The other choices are incorrect because they represent either no change in risk or an increase in risk.
Key Concept:
A relative risk of 1.2 indicates that there is an approximately 20% increased risk for hip fractures associated with not exercising compared with exercising.
This difference is statistically significant because it falls outside the 95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8. Therefore, we can conclude that regular exercise decreases the risk for hip fractures.

"A 33-year-old man undergoes a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. During the operation, moderate hemorrhaging requires ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, serum studies show a calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin concentration of 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 200 pg/mL. Damage to which of the following vessels caused the findings in this patient?
Branch of the costocervical trunk or Branch of the external carotid artery or Branch of the thyrocervical trunk or Tributary of the internal jugular vein.","### Answer: Branch of the external carotid artery
### Explanation: Ligation of the external branch of the superior thyroid artery (ECA), a major source of blood supply to the thyroid gland, would result in hypocalcemia due to loss of parathyroid hormone secretion from the damaged parathyroid glands. Parathyroid hormone stimulates osteoblastic activity and increases bone resorption; therefore, low levels of PTH lead to decreased serum calcium concentrations. In addition, since the ECA provides anastomoses between the common and internal carotid systems, occlusion could cause increased intracranial pressure secondary to reduced cerebral perfusion. This effect would be exacerbated if the ipsilateral internal carotid artery was also occluded during surgery. The other listed vessels provide no direct contribution to the circulation of the head and neck.Diagnosis: Hypoparathyroidism

"A 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees during the past several months. She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, ""I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months."" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her ""drop attacks?""
Adrenal insufficiency or Anxiety or Atlanto-axial instability or Cardiac arrhythmia.","### Answer: Adrenal insufficiency
### Explanation: This patient has Addison disease, which can be caused by adrenal destruction secondary to autoimmune processes (primary adrenalitis), tuberculosis, fungi, malignancy, hemorrhage, trauma, surgery, radiation therapy, or infections. In this case, the primary process was an immunologic reaction against the adrenals, leading to their destruction. Patients often have vague complaints of generalized weakness, hypoglycemia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, and weight loss. They frequently develop salt craving and hyponatremia due to excessive sodium retention. Hypotension, hyperpigmentation, and decreased skin temperature occur late in the course of the illness. The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include lightheadedness on standing, syncope, and shock. These patients usually die within 6 years if untreated. Treatment consists of glucocorticoids and mineralocoicoids.
Anxiety does not produce physical signs unless it becomes severe enough to result in panic attacks. Panic attacks consist of palpitations, sweating, tremors, shortness of breath, chest pain, and feelings of impending death.
Atlanto-axial instability occurs when there is fracture of C1 or C2 vertebrae. It results in spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits.
Cardiac arrhythmias can lead to sudden cardiac arrest but would not present as intermittent paresis.
Diabetes mellitus causes polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss but not muscle weakness.
Myopathy leads to proximal muscle weakness and muscle cramps but not peripheral neuropathy.

"Three days after hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis, an 87-year-old woman refuses insulin injections. She says that her medical condition has declined so much that she no longer wishes to go on living; she is nearly blind and will likely require bilateral leg amputations. She reports that she has always been an active person and does not see how her life will be of value anymore. She has no family and most of her friends are sick or deceased. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of refusing insulin. There is no evidence of depression. She dismisses any attempts by the physician to change her mind, saying that the physician is too young to understand her situation. She says, ""I know I will die, and this is what I want."" Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Discharge the patient after she has signed an ""against medical advice"" form or Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian or Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it or Admit to the psychiatric unit.","### Answer: Discharge the patient after she has signed an ""against medical advice"" form
### Explanation: This elderly lady is making an informed decision regarding her own care. Although she is very ill, she appears competent and fully aware of her choices. Her desire to stop treatment is consistent with her values and beliefs. In these circumstances, discharge from the hospital would be appropriate. If there were concerns about the patient's capacity to make decisions, then a formal assessment of her cognitive functioning might have been indicated before attempting to withdraw therapy. However, since the patient is able to communicate clearly and understands the implications of her choice, no further action is required other than obtaining written consent (an ""against medical advice"" form).
The patient's age alone is not sufficient grounds for seeking a court order to appoint a legal guardian. A court order can only be obtained if there is clear and convincing evidence that the patient lacks the ability to manage his or her affairs. Since the patient here is capable of understanding the risks and benefits of treatment, this criterion is not met.
Although the patient is terminally ill, she still has the right to refuse treatment. It is important to respect patients' autonomy even when their decisions seem unwise to us. Insulin administration against the patient's will could result in litigation.
There is no indication of depression in this case. Depressed individuals often lack energy and motivation and frequently express feelings of hopelessness. They also tend to overestimate the negative aspects of themselves and underestimate positive qualities. None of these features are present in this patient.
Placement in a psychiatric unit would be unnecessary and potentially harmful. Patients who are admitted to psychiatric units typically need intensive symptom control and close monitoring. Neither of these interventions is necessary in this case.
Finally, although the patient is dying, she is not suffering. Pain and other symptoms associated with death must be treated aggressively.

Key Concept:
Autonomous decision-making is allowed in adults who are mentally competent.
Incompetence requires proof through a court hearing.
If the patient makes an autonomous decision, the healthcare provider cannot override the decision.

"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother because of a 3-day history of fever, sore throat, and itchy eyes. He just returned from a weeklong summer camp that included hiking trips and swimming lessons in the camp-owned swimming pool. He has no history of major medical illness and receives no medications. He appears tired. His temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F); other vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows conjunctival injection and discharge and oropharyngeal erythema. The public health department reports an outbreak of similar symptoms among the other campers and camp volunteers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?
Adenovirus or Cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus or Influenza virus.","### Answer: Adenovirus
### Explanation: This child has pharyngitis caused by adenoviral infection. Pharyngitis can be associated with any viral upper respiratory tract infection but is particularly common during epidemics of adenovirus infections. Most cases resolve spontaneously; antibiotics have little effect on the course of disease.
The other choices are not commonly seen causes of pharyngitis.
Diagnosis: Acute adenoviral pharyngitis
Treatment: Supportive measures only
Note: Although influenza can also present with pharyngitis, it would be unusual for all children in a group to become sick simultaneously.
Key Concept:
Most cases of acute pharyngitis are due to viruses, including adenovirus, which is responsible for many outbreaks of pharyngitis in schools and camps.
Reference: Ananthanarayan & Paniker's Textbook of Microbiology                                                                                                                                                       An impoant point to remember here is that while both EBV and CMV can infect salivary glands, they rarely produce clinically significant lesions.
Parvovirus B19 does not infect humans.
Influenza produces primarily bronchopneumonia.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is implicated in exanthem subitum (roseola infantum).
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with infectious mononucleosis.
CMV is associated with congenital infection and pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.
Toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic in adults but can lead to chorioretinitis in neonates.
Rubella is characterized by lymphadenopathy and arthralgia.
Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is associated with shingles.
Herpes simplex type I (HSV-I) is associated with gingivo-labial herpes.
HSV-II is associated with genital herpes.
Primary syphilis presents as a painless papule called a chancre.
Secondary syphilis typically involves the skin and mucous membranes and is accompanied by constitutional symptoms.
LGV is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1, L2, and L3.
Granuloma inguinale is caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatosis.
Donovanosis is caused by Klebsiella granulomatis.
Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.

Diagnostic criteria for primary adenoviral infection

Presence of two or more of the following:

Pharyngitis
Conjunctivitis
Urticaria
Keratoconjunctivitis

In addition, presence of either of the following:

Abdominal cramps
Painful cystitis

Exclusion of other possible diagnoses

Note:

These diagnostic criteria apply to children aged <1 year old.
For older children, these criteria must be met if there is evidence of systemic involvement.
If there is no evidence of systemic involvement, then the diagnosis of adenoviral infection requires laboratory confirmation.

Diagnostic criteria for recurrent adenoviral infection

Recurrence of symptoms consistent with previous episode of adenoviral infection

No further laboratory testing required

Diagnostic criteria for severe adenoviral infection

Symptoms consistent with previous episodes of adenoviral infection plus

One or more of the following:

Dehydration
Malnutrition
Leukopenia

Additional information

Adenovirus types 3, 7, 14, and 21 are associated with hemorrhagic colitis.
Type ",Adenovirus
"A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he has felt nauseated and light-headed for the past hour. Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0°C (96.8°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?
Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting or Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy or Do endotracheal intubation or Do upper endoscopy.","### Answer: Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting
### Explanation: This patient had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding that was severe enough to cause hypovolemic shock. Transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunt (TIPS) is indicated when patients have refractory ascites or recurrent variceal hemorrhage despite medical treatment. TIPS creates communication between the portal venous system and the vena cavae, thus reducing portal hypertension. Vasopressors can be used if there is persistent hypotension after fluid resuscitation. Endotracheal intubation would not be necessary unless the patient became unresponsive again. Upper endoscopy could be done but it might take too long to perform since this patient needs urgent intervention.

"A 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found with a ""blank stare"" and flat facial expression at a party. His pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is sitting upright and appears catatonic. Physical examination shows rigidity. During the examination, he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician. This patient most likely ingested which of the following drugs?
Diazepam or Methamphetamine or Oxycodone or PCP (phencyclidine).","### Answer: PCP (phencyclidine)
### Explanation: Phencyclidine (PCP), also known as angel dust, can cause psychotic episodes that include aggressive behavior, hallucinations, delusions, and amnesia. It has been used recreationally but is no longer available legally because it causes severe adverse effects. Diazepam intoxication would be associated with sedation, confusion, and poor judgment; methamphetamine use results in paranoia, agitation, and tachycardia; oxycodone overdose presents with respiratory depression, coma, and hypotension; and heroin overdose produces bradycardia, apnea, cyanosis, and death.
Diagnosis: Acute phencyclidine poisoning
Learning objectives

Phencyclidine (PCP) was once widely abused but is now rarely seen due to its serious side effect profile.
It is an NMDA receptor antagonist that blocks glutamate action on neurons.
The drug induces euphoria, dissociative anesthesia, analgesia, and profound psychic dependence.
Acute intoxication is characterized by bizarre behavior, including violence, aggression, and self-mutilation.
Chronic users develop tactile hallucinations (""maggot sensitivity"") and have difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy.
Withdrawal symptoms include insomnia, anxiety, tremor, myalgia, and hyperreflexia.
Tolerance develops rapidly, and withdrawal syndrome resolves within 5 days.

Key Concept
Phencyclidine (PCP) was once widely abused but is now rarely seen due to its serious side effect profile.

"A 24-year-old recent college graduate comes to the office because of a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels. She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly ""panicky."" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Recommend behavioral therapy or Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy or Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem or Review the patient's sexual history.","### Answer: Recommend behavioral therapy
### Explanation: This young woman has functional bladder dysfunction (urge incontinence). It is associated with anxiety and panic attacks. Behavioral modification techniques can be used to help patients learn how to control their bladders better. Psychoanalysis would not be indicated here since this is a relatively mild case of functional bladder dysfunction.
The other choices are incorrect because there is no evidence of a neurologic disease or a structural lesion causing these problems.
Diagnosis: Functional bladder dysfunction

"A healthy 2-year-old girl is brought to the office for a routine well-child visit. The child was weaned at 6 months of age and began to walk at 10 months of age. On physical examination, she has mild bowlegs (10-degree genu varum). Which of the following is the most appropriate management to recommend at this time?
Increased intake of vitamin D or A special exercise program or Surgical correction or No treatment is needed at this time.","### Answer: No treatment is needed at this time
### Explanation: Bow legs (genu varum) usually result from abnormal growth patterns during early development. In children who have no other symptoms, there is little evidence that any intervention improves outcomes. If the deformity becomes severe enough to cause painful walking, then surgery can be considered. Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, which results in bowing of the long bones; however, it does not correct established bow legs. There is no indication for an exercise program.

"A 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of fainting for 3 months. He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Right bundle branch block or Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I or Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II or Third-degree atrioventricular block.","### Answer: Right bundle branch block
### Explanation: In right bundle branch block (RBBB), there is delayed conduction through the right bundle branch and right fascicle. This results in a prolonged PR interval. There is usually a widening of QRS complexes due to delayed depolarization of the ventricles. The P wave is normal in amplitude but broad. The QRS complexes are wide, and the ST segment is not changed. AV nodal escape rhythms occur when both atria have impaired conduction, resulting in irregular atrial contractions that drive the ventricle via the AV node. Atrioventricular blocks result from interference with either the atrium or the ventricle. Type I second-degree AV block occurs when only the AV node is affected; the P wave precedes the QRS complex, while the PR interval remains constant. Type II second-degree AV block occurs when the AV node and the bundle branches are affected; the P wave does not conduct to the ventricle until after the QRS complex. Type III second-degree AV block occurs when all three components—the sinus node, the AV node, and the bundle branches—are involved; the P wave is absent, and the QRS complex follows the T wave. Third-degree AV block occurs when none of the cardiac tissue is able to conduct action potentials into the ventricle.
Diagnosis: Right bundle branch block
",Third-degree atrioventricular block
"A 22-year-old woman contacts a medical student and asks if he would like to join her for dinner. The student met the woman when he was assigned to her care during her 2-week hospitalization for treatment of major depressive disorder. He has not treated or seen the patient since she was discharged from the hospital. He is attracted to this former patient and would be interested in dating her. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the medical student regarding this patient's invitation?
He can date her because he was a medical student, not a physician, when he contributed to her care or He can date her because she is no longer his patient or He can date her, but only after at least 1 year has passed since he treated her or He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient.","### Answer: He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient
### Explanation: This case illustrates an important ethical principle that applies to all healthcare professionals. It states that ""a professional relationship between a doctor and a patient does not end until it ends."" In other words, even though the young woman is no longer being treated by the medical student (he did not treat her while she was a patient), their relationship remains intact because they had a therapeutic relationship. As long as the medical student continues to provide any type of service to the woman, including providing information on how to stay well, he must avoid entering into a romantic relationship with her. If he were to enter into a sexual relationship with her, he could face disciplinary charges against him.
The fact that the medical student was a medical student rather than a licensed physician makes no difference; both students and practicing physicians have the same obligations toward patients. Similarly, there is no time limit on these relationships. Even if many years pass before the medical student sees the woman again, he still cannot engage in a personal relationship with her.
Option b is incorrect because the medical student never actually provided direct care to the woman. Although he was present during her admission interview, he played no role in her subsequent care. Therefore, he owes her nothing except respect for her privacy.
Option c is incorrect because the medical student cannot wait for 1 year to elapse before seeing the woman again. Once a patient becomes a former patient, the physician’s duty to protect the confidentiality of the patient ceases. However, the physician’s responsibility to maintain a professional relationship with the patient persists.
Option d is incorrect because the medical student never actually provided direct care to the woman. Although he was present during her admission interview, he played no role in her subsequent care. Therefore, he owes her nothing except respect for her privacy.
Key concept: 
A professional relationship between a doctor and a patient does not end until it ends.

"A 45-year-old woman has a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating; she was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 μU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Acute stress disorder or Agoraphobia or Generalized anxiety disorder or Hypothyroidism.","### Answer: Acute stress disorder
### Explanation: This patient experienced a traumatic event (being robbed at knifepoint), which led to symptoms that began within 4 weeks after the incident. These include hyperarousal (increased alertness, agitation, restlessness, psychomotor agitation, and decreased sleep); avoidance behavior (avoiding places where the trauma occurred); numbing of emotions (depression, detachment from others, feeling estranged, alienated, or isolated); and alterations in cognition (dissociative amnesia). In addition, her physical examination findings suggest sympathetic activation (tachycardia, sweaty palms, dry mouth, pupillary dilation, and tremulousness). Although this episode could be due to acute stress reaction, it lasted longer than expected. If untreated, these patients can develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is characterized by recurrent intrusion of memories of the traumatic events, nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, arousal symptoms, and persistent negative mood. Patients with PTSD have significant impairment in social functioning and occupational performance. Treatment includes pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines, along with psychological therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).
Agoraphobia is defined as fear of being in public places where escape might be difficult or embarrassing or help not be available if inappropriate or dangerous behavior occurs. It usually accompanies panic disorders.
Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive worry and apprehension related to everyday activities. There is no specific precipitating factor. Physical complaints like headache, muscle aches, gastrointestinal upset, and fatigue occur frequently.
Hypothyroidism does not cause anxiety unless there is concomitant adrenal insufficiency.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Obsession refers to recurrent thoughts, ideas, images, or urges that are ego-dystonic and unwanted. Compulsion refers to repetitive acts performed according to the obsession.
Schizophreniform disorder presents with schizophrenia-like features, including delusional thinking, hallucinatory experiences, and bizarre speech patterns. However, unlike schizophrenia, the onset is sudden rather than gradual, and the duration is less than 6 months.
Social phobia involves fear of social interactions resulting in marked distress and avoidance of social situations.

"A 29-year-old Hispanic woman, gravida 3, para 3, comes to the office because of recurrent low back pain during the past year. Rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks. However, the pain seems to recur every 2 to 3 months. Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive. She walks 3 miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal, and physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone or Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine or Order x-rays of the lumbosacral spine or Recommend beginning a weight loss program.","### Answer: Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone
### Explanation: This patient has chronic lower back pain that responds to rest and analgesia but recurs frequently. These findings suggest a diagnosis of sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. Sciatic symptoms can be relieved temporarily by administration of corticosteroids into the epidural space. If this fails, surgical intervention may be necessary. Weight reduction would not help immediately; however, it might prevent future episodes of sciatica.
MRI scanning is indicated if there is neurological deficiency or if conservative treatment does not work. X-rays are used only when there is suspicion of bony pathology.

Image showing the location of the epidural space

​

Epidural Space
The epidural space lies between the dura mater and the vertebral body. It contains loose connective tissue, fat, nerves, vessels, and sometimes plexiform lymph nodes.
It communicates with the subarachnoid space through the intervertebral foramina.
The epidural space extends from the skull base to the sacrum.
In adults, the epidural space is divided into three parts:

Anterior epidural space - located anterior to the veebrae.
Posterior epidural space - located posterior to the veebrae.
Interlaminar epidural space - located between two adjacent veebrae.

Functions

Provides nutrients to the veebral bodies.
Acts as a reservoir for blood.
Serves as a site for absorption of local anesthetics after epidural blockade.

Structures

Dura mater - outermost layer of the meninges.
Arachnoid matter - middle layer of the meninges.
Piamater - innermost layer of the meninges.
Venous plexuses - venous sinuses formed by the confluence of numerous small veins.
Nerve roots - arise from the dorsal primary rami of the spinal cord segments.
Sympathetic chain - consists of ganglia, sympathetic trunks, and branches.
Ligament flavum - fibrous band connecting the laminae of neighboring veebrae.
Foramen transversarium - transmits the veebral aery.
Foramen spinosum - transmits the spinal nerve.
Foramen magnum - transmits the medulla oblongata.

Boundaries

Anterior - Posterior longitudinal ligament, anterior and posterior longitudinal muscles, and the apophysis of the veebrae.
Posterior - Ligament flavum, interspinous ligaments, supraspinous ligaments, facet joint capsules, and the apophyses of the veebrae.
Superior - Dura mater.
Inferior - Interveebral disc.
Medial - Parietal pleura.
Lateral - Extensor digitorum brevis and the skin.

Clinical Significance

Epidural abscess - collection of pus outside the dura mater.
Epidural hemorrhage - bleeding into the epidural space.
Epidural lipomatosis - accumulation of fatty tissue in the epidural space.
Epidural fibrosis - scar formation in the epidural space.
Epidural hematoma - collection of blood in the epidural space.
Epidural infusion - continuous intraparemedial administration of drugs.
Epidural anesthesia - regional anesthetic technique using local anesthetics injected into the epidural space.
Epidural analgesia - use of opioids to provide postoperative analgesia.
Epidural steroid injection - intrathecal injection of glucocorticoids to treat radicular pain.

Key Concept

Her mother says, ""She is getting almost all A's in school and she is on the track team."" You ask the patient about her diet and she responds, ""I'm kind of a picky eater."" She requests a laxative to help with her constipation. She is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 43 kg (95 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2 . Pulse is 65/min. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?
Color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements or Exposure to sexually transmitted diseases or Family history of irritable bowel syndrome or Menstrual history.","### Answer: Color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements
### Explanation: This young woman has chronic constipation that is not related to any other disease process. Chronic constipation can occur from poor nutrition, lack of exercise, medications, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and aging. It is important to obtain information about the color, consistency, and frequency of stools; this helps determine if there is an underlying cause. Irritable bowel syndrome would present with alternating periods of loose and hard stool, bloating, and abdominal discomfort. Sexual activity could lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and genital warts. Family history might reveal familial polyposis coli, colon cancer, or celiac sprue. Menarche typically occurs between ages 10 and 17 years.

​​​​​​​",Menstrual history
"A 37-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of inadequate control of his glucose concentrations for the past 2 months. Despite his poor control, he demands that he be discharged. He reports that he has had a 3-month history of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness. He says that he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, adding, ""Sometimes I forget."" He has been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely. He did not get out of bed for 2 days, which prompted his wife to call an ambulance and have him admitted to the hospital. Prior to admission to the hospital, his only medication was insulin, although he often missed doses. He does not drink alcohol. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2 . His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is tired and has a restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Cognition is intact. His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options or Adhere to the patient's wishes on the condition that he agree to home nursing care or Schedule neuropsychological testing or Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian.","### Answer: Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian
### Explanation: This patient suffers from major depressive disorder complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis. Although he expresses a desire to leave the hospital against medical advice, this decision must be made by someone who can legally make decisions on his behalf. If there were a living will, it would provide guidance; however, if none exists, then a court order to appoint a legal guardian is necessary. In addition, the physician needs to ensure that the patient receives adequate treatment for both his depression and diabetes.
The other choices are incorrect because they fail to address the issue of capacity.
Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder, Diabetic ketoacidosis
Treatment: Insulin therapy, Antidepressants
Drug therapy: Lifelong insulin therapy
Key concept: Capacity refers to the ability to make informed decisions regarding oneself. When patients lack capacity, their health care providers need to seek legal authority to act on their behalf.
Capacity is determined by the presence of impaired judgment, insight, or cognitive function.
Patients with severe psychiatric illnesses frequently lack capacity.
In these cases, the treating physicians must obtain a court order to appoint a legal guardian before making any decisions regarding the patient’s care.
If the patient lacks capacity, the appointed guardianship allows the physician to make decisions on the patient’s behalf.
A durable power of attorney for health care provides similar protection when the patient still retains capacity.
This document authorizes another person to make decisions on the patient’s behalf when the patient becomes unable to make decisions for himself.
It differs from a traditional power of attorney in that it remains valid even after the patient loses capacity.
Whenever possible, the appointment of a legal guardian should precede the use of a durable power of attorney for health care.
However, if the patient refuses to sign a durable power of attorney for health care, the physician may consider using a surrogate decision maker.
Surrogates are designated by state law and serve as proxies for patients who cannot communicate their preferences.
They typically include spouses, adult children, parents, siblings, grandparents, and close relatives.
Although surrogates generally follow the expressed wishes of the patient, they also have a duty to protect the interests of the patient.
These duties include ensuring that the patient receives proper medical care and preventing harmful treatments.
Physicians should consult with the ethics committee whenever conflicts arise between the patient’s autonomy and the best interest of the patient.
For example, if a patient requests termination of life support despite being comatose, the physician should contact the ethics committee to determine how to proceed.
If the patient lacks capacity, the physician should involve the surrogate decision maker in all aspects of the case.
The surrogate makes decisions based upon the known values and beliefs of the patient.
The surrogate decision maker should be involved early in the course of the disease process to allow time for education and planning.
The role of the surrogate decision maker includes determining the goals of care, selecting the team members, and communicating with the rest of the health care team.
The surrogate decision maker should work closely with the nurse practitioner or social worker to coordinate communication among the various disciplines.
The surrogate decision maker should be present during meetings involving the multidisciplinary team.
The surrogate decision maker should receive copies of all written documents related to the patient’s care.
The surrogate decision maker should be available to assist the patient’s primary care provider in coordinating the patient’s care.
The surrogate decision maker should be prepared to handle emergencies and unexpected events.
The surrogate decision maker should know whom to contact in the event of an emergency.
The surrogate decision maker should be aware of the patient’s advance directive.
The surrogate decision maker should understand the principles of palliative care.
The surrogate decision maker should be familiar with the hospice philosophy.
The surrogate decision maker should be knowledgeable about end-of-life issues.
The surrogate decision maker should be able to identify signs of suffering.
The surrogate decision maker should be able to assess the patient’s pain and symptoms.
The surrogate decision maker should be able to initiate convers",Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options
"A 7-month-old infant, who was recently discharged from the hospital following an episode of enteritis and dehydration, has persistent watery diarrhea. His mother feeds him cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is slightly distended. No other abnormalities are seen. The problem is most likely related to which of the following?
Fructose intolerance or Transient lactase deficiency or Magnesium deficiency or Regional enteritis.","### Answer: Fructose intolerance
### Explanation: This child’s symptoms suggest that he suffers from hereditary fructose intolerance, a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by a defect in aldolase B. In this condition, ingestion of fructose results in severe vomiting, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, jaundice, and death within several weeks if untreated. Treatment consists of avoiding fructose and sucrose and administering glucose.
Transient lactase deficiency can be excluded because breast milk contains little lactose; therefore, it would not cause problems in infants until they were weaned onto cow-milk formulas containing lactose.
Magnesium deficiency does not occur in healthy children unless there is malabsorption secondary to another process.
Regional enteritis (crohn’s disease) usually presents later in life.
Diabetes insipidus occurs only rarely in young children and is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia.
Ref : Nelson textbook of pediatrics 20th edition Pgno : 685

Key Concept
Hereditary fructose intolerance is due to absence of enzyme Aldolase B.
It causes Hypoglycemia, Hyperuricemia, Jaundice & Death within few weeks.
Treatment includes avoiding fructose & Sucrose and giving Glucose.

 





































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































",Transient lactase deficiency
"A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. The most appropriate management is to
administer an epidural anesthetic or administer tocolytic therapy or apply cervical topical corticosteroids or augment the labor with oxytocin.","### Answer: apply cervical topical corticosteroids
### Explanation: Cervical ripening can be achieved using various methods including mechanical (fingers), pharmacologic (misoprostol, PGE2 gel), or chemical means (corticosteroid creams). Misoprostol is used primarily when there is concern that the patient might not have access to medical care after delivery. Corticosteroid application is effective in promoting cervical ripening and induction of labor. It works by increasing prostaglandin synthesis within the endometrium and cervix. This method is safe during pregnancy and does not require any special monitoring. However, it requires patience because its effects take longer to manifest compared with other methods.
The use of oxytocin for augmenting uterine activity is generally recommended once the cervix is adequately effaced and dilated. Oxytocin stimulates both myoepithelial cells and smooth muscle fibers of the myometrium, resulting in increased contractility. Tocolysis is indicated if premature birth is anticipated due to maternal hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or placental insufficiency. Epidural analgesia provides excellent relief from pain associated with childbirth; however, it also causes significant loss of sensory input from the perineum, which makes vaginal examination difficult.

"A 15-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because, she says, ""something has been sticking out of my bottom since I had a bowel movement this morning."" She has not had previous episodes, although for more than 1 year she has had occasional difficulty passing stools. She is not in pain but is afraid to move her bowels for fear that the problem will worsen. She tells you that she moved away from home more than a year ago and that her parents contribute nothing to her support. She has a 6-month-old child and lives with a 28-year-old female cousin. She has never been married and does not work or attend school. She has no other symptoms. In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor, which of the following is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem?
Accept the girl's consent as sufficient or Obtain a court order permitting evaluation or Obtain the written consent of at least two licensed physicians or Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents.","### Answer: Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents
### Explanation: Minors cannot legally make decisions regarding their own health care; therefore, they must have an adult present who can provide informed consent on behalf of the minor. If there is no parent available, then another person (such as a guardian), who has legal responsibility for the minor, can sign the form. This rule applies even if the minor is pregnant. It would be unethical to treat the girl before obtaining permission from either parent. Acceptance of the girl's consent alone would violate state law. Although it might seem reasonable to accept the consent of someone else acting on her behalf, doing so could lead to serious consequences. Neither a judge nor a physician can grant permission to perform medical procedures on minors.
The girl is considered emancipated only when she marries or joins the military.

"A 37-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after she was found unconscious on her apartment floor. Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?
Acute respiratory distress syndrome or Acute tubular necrosis or Cerebral edema or Cerebral hemorrhage.","### Answer: Acute renal failure
### Explanation: Renal injury from acute tubular necrosis (ATN), glomerulonephritis, or vascular occlusion can occur in patients who have ingested large quantities of drugs that cause hypotension and shock. In this case, there is evidence of myoglobinuria, which causes proximal tubule damage and ATN. Myoglobin has an affinity for ferric iron, which results in precipitation within the tubules. Patients with severe ATN develop oliguric renal failure; however, mild cases may be asymptomatic until weeks later. The other choices are complications of hypoxia and hypoperfusion rather than direct drug effects.Diagnosis: Drug-induced kidney disease
",Acute tubular necrosis
"A 34-year-old white woman comes to the emergency department because of a persistent dull headache for the past 3 days. She has been taking acetaminophen without relief. She says, ""I haven't slept in 3 days and I am having trouble focusing at work."" There is no history of trauma and she takes no medications. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years but does not drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 86/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 182/100 mm Hg. Examination of the head shows no abnormalities. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light; there is mild photophobia. Funduscopic examination is normal. A serous effusion is noted on examination of the left tympanic membrane. Neck is stiff with painful flexion; when the patient's neck is flexed forward, she reports and electric shock sensation. Mild expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation of the chest. A midsystolic click is heard best at the left sternal border; there are no murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination shows striae, but is otherwise noncontributory. Examination of the lower extremities shows varicosities bilaterally and 1+ edema; muscle strength is 4/5. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following physical findings is most indicative of the need for immediate further evaluation?
Abdominal striae or Expiratory wheezes or Midsystolic click or Neck stiffness.","### Answer: Neck stiffness
### Explanation: This patient has hypertension, hyperpigmentation, and an electrocardiogram showing LVH. These features suggest primary aldosteronism due to adrenal adenoma. Aldosterone excess causes salt retention, which leads to hypeension and fluid overload. Hyperpigmentation occurs from increased levels of melanin stimulated by cortisol. Hyperkalemia can occur if potassium is excreted into the urine. Increased sodium intake increases renal perfusion, leading to polyuria and polydipsia. The combination of hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis predisposes patients to nephrocalcinosis. The presence of neck stiffness suggests meningitis, which would require prompt treatment. Acute severe headaches could indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, or encephalitis. Wheezes could represent asthma, chronic bronchitis, or pneumonia. Clicks can result from mitral valve prolapse, carcinoid syndrome, or aortic regurgitation.
Diagnoses that cause abdominal striae include Cushing’s disease, lipodystrophy, and Crohn’s disease. Diabetes mellitus can lead to peripheral vascular insufficiency and ulcerations.
The patient’s symptoms are consistent with primary aldosteronism. Her presentation warrants further investigation to determine the source of her elevated aldosterone level.
Aldosterone secreting tumors account for approximately 5% of cases of primary aldosteronism. They arise sporadically or are associated with familial syndromes. Familial forms include glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA), Gordon syndrome, and Bartter syndrome type III. GRA presents with early childhood hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. It is caused by mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. Patients have low plasma renin activity and high aldosterone levels. Treatment involves administration of hydrocoisone. Primary aldosteronism due to unilateral adrenal adenomas accounts for 80% of all cases. Unilateral adrenal adenomas typically present between ages 30 and 60. Most commonly they produce clinical features similar to those described above. Bilateral microadenomas make up 10% of cases. These lesions tend to be smaller than 1 cm in diameter and often cannot be detected radiographically. Microadenomas usually present after age 50. These patients also exhibit features similar to those described above. Adrenal carcinomas constitute less than 1% of cases. These lesions are much larger than microadenomas and are frequently found incidentally during imaging studies performed for other reasons. Carcinomas are characterized by their ability to secrete large amounts of aldosterone, resulting in severe hypertension and hypokalemia.
Treatment consists of surgery followed by radiation therapy.
In this case, the patient’s symptoms were likely due to primary aldosteronism due to an adrenal adenoma. However, the possibility of a carcinoma must always be considered. Therefore, CT scan was ordered to rule out any mass.
If it turns out to be an adenoma, then laparoscopic adrenalectomy is indicated. If it turns out to be a carcinoma, then chemotherapy and radiation therapy are needed.
This patient had a very rare condition called Conn’s syndrome.
Conn’s syndrome is characterized by excessive secretion of aldosterone.
It results in hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.
Patients with Conn’s syndrome develop characteristic skin changes known as “moon facies” or “pseudophocomelia.”
These changes consist of thinning of the skin, easy bruising, and poor wound healing.
Other common manifestations of Conn’s syndrome include weakness, fatigue, weight loss, and decreased libido.
Most patients with Conn’s syndrome have hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.
Some patients may experience paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).
PNH is a disorder of red cell metabolism that is characterized by defects",Neck stiffness
"A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician after her mother learned that she began having sexual intercourse with various partners 1 month ago. She does not use condoms or other contraception. The mother is concerned about her behavior. The patient's parents separated 3 months ago. She had been an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership positions at school before the separation. Since the separation, however, she has become sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She has begun smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and being truant from school. This patient is most likely using which of the following defense mechanisms?
Acting out or Displacement or Projection or Reaction formation.","### Answer: Acting out
### Explanation: Adolescents often act out their anger toward their caregivers through rebellion against authority figures (e.g., teachers). In this case, the adolescent is acting out her feelings of abandonment by her father through promiscuity. Her symptomatology suggests a diagnosis of conduct disorder.Discussion: Defense mechanism",Acting out
"A previously healthy 27-year-old man comes to the physician 4 weeks after noticing three nontender lesions on his penis. He says they have not changed in size. He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He takes no medications. He drinks two to five beers on social occasions. He occasionally smokes marijuana. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F). There is no lymphadenopathy. Examination shows three sessile, flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of the penis that are 10 mm in diameter. On application of a dilute solution of acetic acid, the lesions turn white. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Oral acyclovir therapy or Oral doxycycline therapy or Intramuscular penicillin therapy or Cryotherapy.","### Answer: Cryotherapy
### Explanation: These lesions represent genital was. They appear as pearly white papules surrounded by an erythematous halo. Genital was can occur anywhere from the perianal area to the glans penis. It is caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11. Treatment consists of cryosurgery or trichloroacetic acid applications. Condyloma accuminata is another name used interchangeably with genital was. Acid fast staining is done using Giemsa or Wright stain. Doxycycline is indicated only if there is concurrent urethritis due to Chlamydia trachomatis. Penicillin would treat syphilis but not chancroid.
Acyclovir treats herpes simplex virus type I and II infections.
Itraconazole is used against dermatophytosis.
Metronidazole is effective against Trichomonas vaginalis.
Erythromycin is used against gonorrhea.
Boric acid powder is applied topically for treatment of vaginitis.
Shave biopsy is contraindicated because it spreads the disease.
Laser ablation has been tried recently.

"A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He also has been confused and agitated during this period. He has a history of mild hypertension. His current medication is a diuretic. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 70/47 mm Hg. Physical examination shows delayed capillary refill of the lips and nail beds and cool extremities. His oxyhemoglobin saturation in a central vein is 60% (N=70–75). These findings are most consistent with which of the following types of shock?
Cardiogenic or Distributive or Hypovolemic or Obstructive.","### Answer: Cardiogenic
### Explanation: This patient has cardiac tamponade due to acute pericarditis from viral myocarditis. Increased intracranial pressure can cause confusion and agitation. The decreased peripheral resistance results in poor perfusion of the kidneys, liver, and gastrointestinal tract; hence, the symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The hypotension leads to tachycardia and bradycardia. The low oxygen saturation indicates that there is an insufficient amount of oxygen being delivered to the body tissues.
The other choices are not associated with these signs and symptoms.
Diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade
Treatment: Pericardiocentesis
""Pericardial effusions are common after MI.""
This statement is true but it does not explain why patients develop tamponade. Tamponade occurs when fluid accumulates rapidly within the pericardium causing compression of the heart. It usually follows trauma, surgery, inflammation, neoplasm, uremia, or hemorrhage into the sac surrounding the heart. Viruses have been implicated in up to half of cases of acute pericarditis.
Patients present with sudden onset of severe chest pain, fever, pleurisy, and dyspnea. They often appear anxious, diaphoretic, and tachypneic. Pulses are bounding, and jugular venous distention is marked. There is a decrease in systolic arterial pressure, a narrowed pulse pressure, and a rapid heaving character of the pulse. The JVP is elevated with prominent x descent. Tachycardia is evident, and Kussmaul sign may be positive.
ECG reveals sinus tachycardia, ST segment depression, and Q waves. Chest roentgenogram demonstrates enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis. Treatment consists of needle aspiration through the second intercostal space just lateral to the sternum.
Aortic dissection causes obliterative endarteritis of the coronary vessels resulting in infarction.
Hemodynamic changes seen in congestive heart failure include increased systemic vascular resistance, decreased stroke volume, and decreased cardiac output.
In hypovolemic shock, there is decreased cardiac output secondary to reduced filling pressures.
Obstructive shock is caused by obstruction of the main artery of the circulatory system.
Distributive shock is caused by vasodilation and pooling of blood in the venous compartment.
Pneumonia is the most frequent cause of community-acquired septicemia.
Septic embolization is the result of bacterial seeding of the bloodstream via an abnormal valveless communication between two normally noncommunicating sites.
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease is a form of chronic lung disease that affects immunocompromised individuals.
Bacterial pneumoniae is the most common pathogen responsible for community-acquired pneumonia.
Viral pneumonias are caused by influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, measles, varicella zoster, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, human papilloma virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus type 8.
Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of nosocomial pneumonia.
Most common organism isolated from CAPD-related shunts is Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Lobar pneumonia is the most common complication of measles.
Acute bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in children younger than age 2 years.
Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is caused by Naegleria fowleri.
Rhinosporidiosis is caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi.
Aspergillus species are the most common fungi causing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
Allergic alveolar proteinosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of proteinaceous material in the air spaces of the lungs.
Chronic granulomatous disease is a primary neutrophil function defect that predisposes affected patients to recurrent pyogenic infections.

"A 13-month-old child is brought to the emergency department because of urticaria, swelling of the lips, and difficulty breathing immediately after eating an egg. A potential risk for hypersensitivity reaction is posed by vaccination against which of the following illnesses?
Hepatitis or Influenza or Pertussis or Poliomyelitis.","### Answer: Hepatitis
### Explanation: (a) Source: GAS 456; GA 90, 789The symptoms described suggest that this patient has had an immediate allergic response to egg protein contained within the hepatitis B vaccine. This type of immune response can be prevented if the physician warns parents before administering the vaccine. Immediate reactions occur within minutes of exposure to antigen and include respiratory distress, angioedema, laryngeal edema, and anaphylaxis. Delayed reactions typically develop over several hours to days and consist of fever, malaise, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and generalized erythematous skin lesions.
(b) Vaccines used to protect against influenza viruses are grown on embryonated chicken eggs. However, these vaccines have not been associated with any serious adverse effects, including anaphylactic shock.
(c) The pertussis component of DTaP vaccine is derived from Bordetella pertussis bacterial cultures grown in large quantities in animal cell lines. No evidence exists suggesting that this vaccine causes severe allergic responses.
(d) Oral poliovirus vaccine contains live attenuated virus strains grown in monkey kidney cells. Although rare cases of paralysis have occurred among recipients of OPV, no reports exist describing life-threatening anaphylactic reactions.
(e) Yellow fever vaccine consists of live attenuated virus strain 17D grown in human diploid fibroblast culture. While it does cause a febrile reaction in many patients, there is no record of fatal anaphylactic reactions occurring due to its administration.

"A 27-year-old man is admitted to the hospital 45 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. Physical examination shows a sluggish response to stimuli. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?
Adenylyl cyclase or Ca2+ channels or Janus kinase or Serine kinase.","### Answer: Vasopressin receptor
### Explanation: Desmopressin (DDAVP), an analogue of vasopressin, acts on V2 receptors to increase water permeability across renal tubular cells. This results in concentrated urine that can be used to treat central diabetes insipidus. Increasing plasma osmolarity through DDAVP treatment also causes release of ADH from pituitary gland. Activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to cAMP production; opening of L-type calcium channels allows entry of calcium into neurons; phosphorylation of tyrosine residues activates Janus kinases; binding of ATP to sodium ion channel regulatory subunits opens the channel; and cleavage of proteins by chymotrypsin releases fragments.

"A 35-year-old female develops nausea and vomiting after she underwent a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus. Her body mass index was 23 kg/m2 before surgery, and, except for the cholecystitis, she was in good health. The patient remains unable to eat 6 days after surgery. Which of the following forms of nutritional support is most appropriate for this patient?
central hyperalimentation or feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube or oral fat-free modular diet or peripheral hyperalimentation.","### Answer: central hyperalimentation
### Explanation: Central venous access allows direct administration of glucose solutions into the superior vena cava. This method can be used when enteral nutrition cannot provide adequate calories because of intestinal obstruction (ileus). It also has advantages over parenteral hyperalimentation in that it does not require large volumes of fluid and permits better control of blood sugar levels. However, there is an increased risk of sepsis from bacterial contamination of the central line. Enteral nutrition would have been preferable if available but could not sustain her needs during prolonged ileus. Parenteral hyperalimentation requires larger volumes of solution and carries greater risks of electrolyte imbalance and metabolic complications. Oral fat-free modular diets are useful only in patients who are able to tolerate food ingestion.

"A 27-year-old nurse comes to the emergency department because of nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration for the past 3 hours. She has had similar episodes over the past 6 months. The symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks. She says that she has had a great deal of stress. She has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month; before this time, she seldom drank alcohol. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL. Intravenous glucose is administered, and the patient's symptoms improve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Measurement of serum proinsulin and insulin antibodies or Measurement of serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations or Measurement of serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C concentrations or Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations.","### Answer: Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations
### Explanation: This young woman presents with classic symptoms of hypoglycemia. Although her blood sugar level was normalized after administration of intravenous glucose, it would have remained low if she were not treated. Hypoglycemia can occur spontaneously but also occurs when an individual consumes foods high in carbohydrates (e.g., fruit juices). It is often precipitated by physical activity, especially during fasting periods. The treatment consists of rapid administration of glucose, which rapidly raises blood glucose levels. If there is evidence of recurrent hypoglycemia, measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations is indicated. Insulin secretion is increased in response to elevated blood glucose levels. When blood glucose falls below a certain threshold, however, insulin secretion increases further. This results in decreased blood glucose levels due to uptake into cells. Persons who develop hypoglycemia frequently secrete large amounts of insulin relative to their body weight. They usually lack other endocrine disorders except for isolated cases of hyperthyroidism. Patients with diabetes mellitus typically exhibit elevated serum glucagon levels rather than hypoglycemia. Serum proinsulin and insulin antibody measurements are used in the diagnosis of type I DM. These tests are negative in patients with pancreatic tumors. Serum cortisol and ACTH determinations are used in the diagnosis of adrenal disease. Growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C levels are measured in the diagnosis of acromegaly.
Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia
Symptoms: Dizziness, Nervousness, Palpitations, Sweating
Physical examination findings: No abnormalities
Lab studies:
Serum glucose concentration: 30 mg/dL
Intravenous glucose: Improves symptoms
Most likely diagnosis: Hypoglycemia
Next best test: Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations
Differential diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus, Pancreatic tumor, Hyperthyroidism

"A 54-year-old woman comes to the office because she has had intermittent shooting pain over her right cheek and jaw during the past 3 weeks. Each episode of pain lasts for 1 second or less. The pain is often triggered by cold air, chewing, tactile stimulation, and brushing her teeth. She has had no trauma to the face or head. Medical history is remarkable for tension headaches, obesity, and gastric bypass surgery. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. The patient cannot tolerate touch over the right side of the face. There is no facial weakness or loss of sensation. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. CT scan of the head with and without contrast shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?
Carbamazepine or Lamotrigine or Levetiracetam or Topiramate.","### Answer: Carbamazepine
### Explanation: This patient has trigeminal neuralgia. It can be idiopathic or associated with multiple sclerosis, tumors, vascular compression, or other causes. Trigeminal neuralgias are characterized by paroxysmal lancinating pain that radiates from the face to the neck. They typically occur every few minutes and last seconds. Painful episodes usually wax and wane but tend to become progressively worse over months to years. Treatment includes carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, baclofen, clonazepam, and nerve blocks. Surgical treatment involves microvascular decompression, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, or percutaneous rhizotomy.
Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug used primarily for partial seizures.
Levetiracetam is another newer antiepileptic agent effective against partial seizures.
Topiramate is also approved for use in adults with focal onset seizures.
Valproate is commonly used for generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
Diazepam is useful for acute seizure control.

"A 12-year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus is brought to the office by his mother for an initial visit. The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140–200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c obtained last week was 5.4%. The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 72/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c?
His daily glucose control is better than recorded or His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced or His hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated or His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1c.","### Answer: His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced
### Explanation: Fingerstick blood glucose monitoring provides valuable information regarding the effectiveness of treatment plans. However, it can also provide misleading data if performed improperly. For example, if the glucometer used by this patient reads higher than actual values, then the reported readings would appear lower on the chart when compared with the true value. This could lead to underestimation of glycemic excursions and poorer overall control. In contrast, if the glucometer were reading too low, then the apparent control would seem worse than expected. Hemoglobin A1c reflects average levels over the previous 2-month period. It does not fluctuate significantly within a day unless there have been significant changes in glucose control. Sickle cell disease is associated with microvascular occlusive events, which can cause tissue damage but typically do not alter the course of diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and dehydration. Patients who develop DKA often present with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, confusion, and coma. If left untreated, severe hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and cerebral edema can occur.
Diagnosis: Poor glycemic control

"A 68-year-old female has a history of breast cancer that has recurred twice in the past 5 years. She has undergone both radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma to the bone. She presents to the office today to ask for help in dealing with midthoracic back pain to enable her to use less analgesic agents. The most appropriate osteopathic manipulative technique to treat this patient's spine is
high velocity, low amplitude or indirect myofascial release or isotonic exercise therapy or mid velocity, mid amplitude.","### Answer: high velocity, low amplitude
### Explanation: High velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) techniques are used primarily for joint mobilization and soft tissue relaxation. HVLA techniques can be applied to any joint in the body; however, they have been found to be particularly effective when applied to the cervical and thoracic regions of the spine. In addition, these techniques are often used to relieve muscle spasm associated with acute injuries.
Indirect myofascial release (IMFR) is an advanced technique that involves applying sustained pressure on the skin while actively contracting the overlying muscles against resistance provided by the osteopathic physician. This technique is commonly used to break up scar tissue and adhesions within the fascia. IMFR is usually performed after other OMT techniques have failed to provide adequate relief from symptoms.
Isometric exercises involve contraction of skeletal muscles against resistance provided by the osteopathic physician. These exercises are designed to increase strength and endurance. Isotonic exercises involve movement of the limbs through full range of motion using weights or resistance bands. These exercises are designed to improve flexibility and balance.
Mid-velocity, mid-amplitude (MVMMA) techniques are typically used to stretch muscles and tendons. MVMMA techniques are also useful for improving posture and reducing painful conditions related to poor posture.

"A 55-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the lung is admitted to the hospital to undergo chemotherapy. Six days after treatment is started, she develops a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 100/mm3 (5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes). Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count?
Darbepoetin or Dexamethasone or Filgrastim or Interferon alfa.","### Answer: Filgrastim
### Explanation: This patient has developed febrile neutropenia during cancer chemotherapy. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (filgrastim) can be used to prevent or treat this complication. Darbepoetin would not help because it acts on erythrocyte precursors; dexamethasone could worsen her bacterial infection; interferon alpha might actually cause fever but would have little effect on granulocyte counts; and vitamin B12 supplementation would not affect neutrophil production.
Filgrastim is also indicated for patients who require autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is administered subcutaneously once per day until engraftment occurs.
The primary use of darbepoetin is anemia associated with chronic kidney disease.
Dexamethasone is commonly used to reduce inflammation caused by many conditions including asthma, allergies, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplants.
Interferons are used primarily against viral diseases.
Vitamin B12 deficiency results from malabsorption secondary to gastritis, diverticulosis, ileocecal disease, or pancreatic insufficiency.
""Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (GCSF)""
This protein was first isolated from human urine and named GCSF based upon its ability to promote growth of colonies of mouse cells that differentiate into granulocytes. In humans, recombinant filgrastim is produced using genetic engineering techniques and is available for clinical use.
Filgrastim is used to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from the marrow before autografting them back into the recipient host. It is also used to prevent or treat severe neutropenia resulting from anticancer therapies.
In addition, filgrastim is being studied as a possible adjunctive agent in the management of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non–small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and Crohn’s disease.
Filgrastim is a glycoprotein composed of two polypeptide chains linked together by disulfide bridges. Its amino acid sequence differs slightly from endogenous GCSF.
It is manufactured by recombinant DNA technology and purified by chromatography.
Filgrastim is administered subcutaneously once daily.
Its half-life averages approximately 24 hours.
Because filgrastim binds to specific receptors only when they are present on mature neutrophils, it does not exert any effects on immature cells in the marrow.
Therefore, unlike other cytokines, filgrastim cannot induce megakaryocytic differentiation or platelet release from the marrow.
Filgrastim is metabolized by plasma proteins and renal clearance.
Approximately 70% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered unchanged in the feces within 6 days.
The remaining 30% appears in the urine over several weeks.
Adverse Effects
Common adverse events include pain, swelling, redness, and warmth at the injection site.
Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, and flushing.
Less common adverse effects include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, thrombophlebitis, urticaria, pruritus, edema, and hematuria.
Rare serious adverse effects include anaphylaxis, respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, and sudden death.
Patients receiving filgrastim should avoid vigorous exercise and contact sports.
Pregnancy Category C
No adequate and well-controlled trials have been conducted in pregnant women.
Reproduction studies performed in rabbits and monkeys did not reveal evidence of embryofetal harm.
However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.
Filgrastim crosses the placenta.
Because there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, caution should be exercised if filgrastim is prescribed to a woman who is pregnant or intends to become pregnant.

Blood smear or Bone marrow biopsy or KOH preparation or Microscopic examination of the stool.","### Answer: Blood smear
### Explanation: This patient has enterobiasis caused by Enterobius vermicularis, which can be seen on microscopy of the blood. Eggs from this parasite pass through the intestines into the feces; they hatch in the soil, releasing larvae that crawl onto vegetables and fruit. These larvae mature into adult worms within several days after ingestion. Infection occurs when eggs are swallowed during itching episodes. Diagnosis requires demonstration of the characteristic egg, which measures approximately 60 x 25 mm. The other choices would not provide an immediate diagnosis but might help confirm the diagnosis if positive.Diagnosis: Pinworm infestation
Explanation: Ans. A. Blood smearEnterobiasis is also known as pinworm disease. It is characterized by intense perianal pruritis, often accompanied by vaginitis in girls. The female lays her eggs near the anal margin, causing irritation and severe itching. The eggs are oval, measuring 70-90 mm long and 25-35 mm wide. They have a smooth surface covered with small bumps. The eggs are found in the feces, under the fingernails, and on clothing. The life cycle begins when the eggs hatch, releasing embryonated larvae. The larvae then develop into cysticercoids, which encapsulate and become nonmotile. The cysticerci penetrate the wall of the large bowel and travel via the portal veins to the liver, where they form cysticercus cellulosae. After 1 week, these cysticerci rupture, liberating the adult worms, which begin their migration back down the portal venous system toward the colon. The adult worms lay eggs daily, each containing up to 100 embryonated larvae. The eggs are passed out of the body with the feces. The male worm dies shortly after copulation, while the female lives for another month or two. The average lifespan of the female is 1 year.
The symptoms of enterobiasis include pruritus ani, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The presence of the eggs causes inflammation and edema of the skin surrounding the anus. The lesions appear as linear streaks of erythematous macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusted excoriations. The condition usually resolves spontaneously within 2 months. Treatment consists of albendazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 day), mebendazole (100 mg once daily for 3 days), or piperazine citrate (1 gm three times daily for 3 days).
Pyrantel pamoate (11 mg/kg PO qd for 2 days) is effective against the adult worms only. Ivermectin (200 mcg/kg PO single dose) is used in children older than 15 years old.
In addition to treating all family members, thorough cleaning of bedding, carpets, furniture, and floors is necessary. Children must wash their hands before going to sleep.
Avoidance of scratching and application of topical corticosteroid creams reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infections.
Mebendazole is highly effective against hookworms, roundworms, whipworms, and tapeworms. Albendazole is active against many helminths including Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis, Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia saginata, T. solium, Hymenolepis nana, Dracunculus medinensis, and Onchocerca volvulus.
Albendazole is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its teratogenicity. Mebendazole is safe in pregnancy.
Ivermectin is approved for treatment of scabies and strongyloidosis. It is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of ivermectin.
It is administered orally at a dosage of 200 mcg/kg. Patients should avoid sun expos",Microscopic examination of the stool

After listening to his requests and weighing your obligations, you should disclose this patient's diagnosis only to which of the following?
His Cocaine Anonymous sponsor or His probation officer or His wife or Insurance company.","### Answer: None
### Explanation: This patient’s information must remain confidential under federal law. If he were being treated for alcoholism, then it would be appropriate to inform his spouse that he was an alcoholic because she might need to know how to help him stay away from bars. However, if the patient had been arrested for drunk driving, then the physician could report this fact to the police department. Similarly, if the patient had threatened someone while intoxicated, then the physician could report this threat to the authorities. It is important to remember that patients have rights; however, these rights can sometimes conflict with other laws. For example, child abuse cases require reporting to the state even though parents have a right to privacy regarding their children.
In this case, the patient wants to keep his addiction private, and the physician cannot reveal any information unless required to do so by law. The physician needs to explain to the patient why he cannot tell others about his condition. The physician can say something like “I understand that you want me to respect your wishes, but I am legally bound to protect my patients.”
The physician should never discuss medical matters outside of the office, especially over the phone. Patients often call the doctor when they feel upset or angry, and they may make threats against themselves or others. These calls should always be documented carefully.
If the patient makes a suicide attempt during the course of therapy, the physician should immediately notify the family members who live with the patient. Family members may be able to provide additional support and watchfulness. They may also be able to prevent future attempts at self-harm.
It is very difficult to predict who will commit suicide and who will not. Some people try several times before finally succeeding. Other people seemingly recover completely and go back to living normal lives. Therefore, it is essential to take all suicidal gestures seriously and document them thoroughly.
A patient who has made previous suicide attempts should be seen frequently until the crisis passes. Even if the patient seems better, the physician should continue seeing the patient regularly. Suicide is usually committed impulsively, and frequent visits allow the physician to monitor the situation closely.
Patients who are depressed tend to see things negatively. When asked how they are doing, they respond by saying that everything is terrible. Depression causes pessimistic thinking patterns. People who are depressed often believe that nothing will ever get better. They may become hopeless and helpless.
Depression can cause physical symptoms including fatigue, sleep disturbances, weight changes, loss of appetite, decreased libido, and constipation. Depression can also affect mood, causing feelings of sadness, guilt, anxiety, irritability, and anger.
Physicians should screen for depression whenever they encounter a patient who appears to be suffering from emotional problems. Screening questions include asking about past history of depressive episodes, current symptomatology, and suicidal thoughts.
Whenever possible, the physician should ask permission to speak with the patient alone. Sometimes, the patient’s partner or friend accompanies the patient to appointments. If this occurs, the physician should politely excuse himself and leave the room.
Once the patient is alone, the physician should begin by expressing concern for the patient’s well-being. The physician should acknowledge that the patient is experiencing difficulties and offer empathetic understanding. Then, the physician should ask open-ended questions to gather further information. Finally, the physician should summarize the information obtained and suggest next steps.
For example, the physician might say, ""You appear to be struggling with some personal issues. Can you tell me more?"" Or, ""How have you been feeling lately?” Or, “What brings you here today?”
After obtaining sufficient information, the physician should recommend specific treatments based upon the patient’s presentation. Treatment options may include antidepressant medications, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, or referral to specialists.
Regardless of the treatment plan chosen, the physician should emphasize the importance of follow-up care. Follow-up visits typically occur every few weeks. During each visit, the physician should assess progress toward goals set previously. If necessary, adjustments can be made to the treatment plan.
Finally, the physician should reiterate the importance of maintaining contact between sessions. Encouragement should be provided to seek assistance quickly if new problems arise.
This approach allows the physician to build trust with the patient and provides a framework for addressing future concerns. By taking a proactive stance, the physician helps ensure that the patient receives adequate care",Insurance company
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a physical examination prior to participating in sports. He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?
Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) or Normal development.","### Answer: Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor
### Explanation: Breast enlargement in males can be caused by an estrogen-producing tumor of the testicle (Leydig cell tumor), adrenal glands, or other sites. In addition, there are several genetic disorders associated with gynecomastia. These include Klinefelter syndrome, which results from seminiferous tubule dysgenesis; McCune-Albright syndrome, characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cafe au lait spots, and endocrine abnormalities; and Turner syndrome, resulting from XO chromosomal abnormality. Gynecomastia does not occur normally until puberty.

"A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of nonradiating low back pain for 3 days. The pain began after he worked in his yard. He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Bed rest or Regular activity or X-rays of the spine or MRI of the spine.","### Answer: Bed rest
### Explanation: This patient has acute lumbar strain. It can be caused by lifting heavy objects and sudden twisting motions. Back pain usually resolves over several weeks but bedrest is recommended during this time. Restoration of function occurs gradually once symptoms have subsided. Physical therapy exercises help prevent recurrence. Analgesics include NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen), opioids, and muscle relaxants. If there is no improvement after 4–6 weeks, further investigation is indicated.
Regular activity would worsen the condition. X-rays of the spine would not reveal anything abnormal initially; they might show degenerative changes later on. MRI of the spine would also not provide information early on. CT scan of the spine could be done if there was suspicion of fracture.
Diagnosis: Acute lumbar strain
Treatment: Bed rest, analgesic medications, physical therapy

"A 29-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because she has had increasingly severe lower abdominal pain and nausea for the past 2 days. She is sexually active and does not use any contraception. Her last menstrual period ended 6 days ago. Temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F). Physical examination discloses abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants bilaterally with rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination discloses leukorrhea at the cervical os and tenderness of the uterus to palpation. The adnexal areas are tender but no masses are palpable. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic study?
Cervical culture or Culdocentesis or Laparoscopy or Serum β-hCG concentration.","### Answer: Serum β-hCG concentration
### Explanation: This patient has acute salpingitis secondary to gonococcal or chlamydial infection. Salpingitis can be either interstitial or tuboovarian. Interstitial salpingitis causes peritoneal irritation that leads to pelvic pain and fever. Tuboovarian salpingitis usually presents with an ectopic pregnancy. In this case, the history suggests that the patient recently became sexually active and did not use barrier protection during coitus. The serum β-hCG level would confirm the presence of an intrauterine gestational sac. If it were negative, then the diagnosis could be confirmed by laparotomy.
The other choices are not indicated in the management of this condition.
Diagnosis: Acute salpingitis
Treatment: Antibiotics
Drug therapy: Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin
Complications: Ectopic pregnancy
Also know:
Risk factors for PID include multiple sexual partners, lack of condom use, new partner, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, douching, IUD, STIs, and poor hygiene.
Symptoms of PID include mild to moderate lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, purulent cervical secretions, and fever.
Signs of PID include cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, adnexal mass, and rebound tenderness.
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):

Inflammation of the upper female genital tract
Most common cause is Neisseria gonorrhoeae followed by Chlamydia trachomatis
Other organisms implicated in causation include Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus species, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococci, Staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Trichomonas vaginitis, Candida albicans, and herpes simplex virus.

Pathogenesis:

Invasion of the endometrial cavity by bacteria from the vagina through the cervix
Bacteremia occurs when the bacteria enter the bloodstream via the cervix
Endometrium becomes edematous and necrotic
Peritoneal fluid accumulation due to increased capillary permeability

"A 57-year-old woman comes to the office for a preoperative evaluation 2 weeks before undergoing scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. Family history is significant for stable angina in her father and rheumatoid arthritis in her mother. The patient has a 102-year-old grandmother who resides in a nursing care facility and has Parkinson disease. The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. During the interview, her face is expressionless. She has a flexed posture and is unable to open her mouth wide. She is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 81 kg (179 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms, as well as mild kyphosis. Strength testing shows no abnormalities; muscle tension is normal. Passive and active range of motion of the upper extremities is full. Gait is slow and deliberate. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Prior to surgery, further evaluation is indicated for which of the following conditions in this patient?
Parkinson disease or Progressive supranuclear palsy or Sarcopenia or Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).","### Answer: Sarcopenia
### Explanation: This patient presents with features suggestive of sarcopenia, an age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass that can lead to functional impairment. Although it occurs naturally during aging, it can also occur secondary to other diseases. In addition to its impact on mobility, sarcopenia increases risk for falls, fractures, hospitalization, and mortality. It is associated with increased morbidity and decreased survival after major operations. There is currently no effective treatment for sarcopenia. Patients with progressive supranuclear palsy have difficulty initiating movements and maintaining balance. They often develop depression and suicidal ideation. These patients require assistance with activities of daily living. Treatment includes levodopa and antidepressants. Patients with systemic sclerosis present with Raynaud phenomenon, digital ulcers, and telangiectasias. Skin involvement leads to fibrosis and contractures. Pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary artery hypeension are common complications. Renal failure and esophageal dysmotility are additional manifestations. Treatment involves calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressives.
Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis typically present with weakness and wasting of the limbs, speech difficulties, and bulbar symptoms. Progression is rapid, usually within months. Death results from respiratory insufficiency. No specific therapy exists. Riluzole prolongs life expectancy.
Diagnoses listed in choices A through D are unlikely causes of sarcopenia.
Diagnosis: Sarcopenia
Treatment: Nutritional supplements, exercise programs

It is associated with increased morbidity and decreased survival after major operations.
There is currently no effective treatment for sarcopenia.
Nutritional supplements and exercise programs are recommended.

About Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis
ALS is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 gene.
The pathology consists of astrocytic gliosis, demyelination, and neuronal loss.
Most cases are sporadic but familial forms exist.
Clinically, there is asymmetric motor paralysis beginning in the lower limb distal muscles.
Prognosis is poor with death occurring due to respiratory insufficiency.
Riluzole prolongs life expectancy.

"A 40-year-old man comes to the office for a preemployment physical examination. The patient has been generally healthy. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no routine medications. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid, 1-cm nodule. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
CT scan of the neck or Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule or Radionuclide thyroid scan or Thyroidectomy.","### Answer: Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule
### Explanation: FNAC is the investigation of choice for solitary thyroid nodules. It can differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. If it reveals papillary carcinoma, total thyroidectomy is indicated. In case of follicular neoplasm, central compartmentalization biopsy (CAB) is done followed by hemithyroidectomy if CAB is positive.
Thyroid scintigraphy is used when there is clinical suspicion of metastatic disease. CT scan of the neck is not useful unless there is clinical evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy.
Total thyroidectomy is usually performed only after confirming the diagnosis of cancer by FNA cytology.
Hemithyroidectomy is rarely required nowadays except in cases where the tumor involves the isthmus or medial half of the thyroid lobes.
In children, subtotal thyroidectomy is preferred because of the high incidence of hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy.

Key Concept:
Fine needle aspiration cytology is the best method to evaluate any thyroid swelling.
Reference: SRB's Manual of Surgery, 5th edition

\section{Know the Steps in Management of Solitary Nodule}

The steps involved in management of solitary thyroid nodule are as follows:

Step 1 - Evaluation of size of nodule
Size > 1 cm → FNAC
Size < 1 cm → Follow up every 6 months till size increases to 1 cm.

Step 2 - FNAC result
Benign → No further treatment needed
Malignant → Total thyroidectomy + Central compartmentalization biopsy (if follicular neoplastic lesion).

Step 3 - Treatment of Malignancy
If FNAC report is suggestive of malignancy then total thyroidectomy is done.
Central compartmentalization biopsy is done in case of follicular neoplastic lesion.

Step 4 - Postoperative follow up
Postoperatively, patients are monitored on TSH levels and ultrasound.

Step 5 - Radioiodine ablation
Radioactive iodine ablation is used in recurrent cases.
It is also used in residual cases.

Step 6 - Follow up
Patients are followed up regularly for radioiodine uptake studies.

Step 7 - Second look operation
Second look operation is done in case of persistent disease.

Step 8 - External beam radiotherapy
External beam radiation therapy is used in second look operations.

Step 9 - Indications for surgery
Indications for surgery include:

Recurrence of disease despite adequate RI ablation.
Residual disease despite adequate RI ablation.
Persistent disease despite adequate RI ablation.
Metastasis.

Step 10 - Overall prognosis
Overall prognosis depends upon age of presentation, histological type of cancer, extent of disease, presence of metastases and response to initial treatment.

Note:

Prophylactic removal of contralateral lobe is not recommended.

Also Know

Treatment of Papillary Carcinoma

Papillary carcinomas are treated primarily by complete resection of the affected lobe.

Treatment of Follicular Carcinoma

Follicular carcinomas are treated similarly to follicular adenomas.
They are removed en bloc along with capsule and",Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule
"A 2-month-old female is brought to the office for her first routine health maintenance examination and for her immunization update. In order to determine whether or not any contraindications exist for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DtaP) immunization, the parents should be questioned regarding
allergy to eggs or Apgar scores at birth or gestational age at birth or previous seizures.","### Answer: allergy to eggs
### Explanation: Contraindications to DTaP include egg hypersensitivity; encephalopathy within 7 days after administration of a previous dose of the vaccine or peussis component of another vaccine containing peussis; progressive neurologic disease; Guillain-Barre syndrome within 6 weeks following an influenza vaccination; severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of DTaP; and moderate or large local reactions following a previous dose of DTP or DTaP.
Apgar score and gestational age have no relationship to the risk of adverse effects from this vaccine. Previous seizure does not preclude use of the vaccine.

"A male neonate, who was born at 36 weeks' gestation 2 hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital, now shows signs of respiratory difficulty. The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Group B streptococcal sepsis or Meconium aspiration syndrome or Respiratory distress syndrome or Transient tachypnea of newborn.","### Answer: Respiratory distress syndrome
### Explanation: This term neonate has features consistent with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Risk factors include prematurity, maternal diabetes, maternal cigarette use, prolonged rupture of membranes, and low birth weight. In this case, the baby had a history of intrauterine growth restriction secondary to decreased placental function from chlamydia pneumoniae infection. The clinical presentation includes moderately severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, and diffuse crackles over both lung fields. X-ray findings show hyperinflated lungs with poorly defined diaphragmatic contours, increased pulmonary vascular marking, and perihilar haze. Treatment consists of supplemental oxygen, which improves oxygenation but does not improve lung compliance. Surfactant replacement therapy can be administered if there is no improvement after 30 minutes of oxygen administration. Group B streptococcal sepsis would present with fever, leukocytosis, and purulent meningitis. Meconium aspiration syndrome presents with hypoxemia, metabolic acidosis, and frothy meconium-stained nasogastric secretions. Transient tachypnea of the newborn occurs when excessive amounts of surfactant are produced and retained within the alveoli. It usually resolves spontaneously within several days. Persistent pulmonary hypoplasia results from chronic exposure to maternal glucocoicoids and is characterized by small chests, narrow thoraxes, short ribs, and abnormalities of the upper limbs.
Diagnosis: Respiratory distress syndrome
Therapy: Supplemental oxygen

​
Key Concept
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS):
It is also called hyaline membrane disease.
The incidence of RDS is reduced by antenatal steroid treatment.
Surfactant deficiency causes collapse of alveolar walls.
Lung compliance is normal but tidal volume is high.
Oxygen therapy is required.
Exogenous surfactant is used in severe cases.
Mothers of infants with RDS have higher levels of IgG antibodies against surfactant proteins.

"A study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?
Chance of a type I error or Chance of a type II error or Power of the study or Sensitivity of the study.","### Answer: Power of the study
### Explanation: Increasing sample size increases power (1 - b). Decreasing alpha value decreases chance of a type I error. Increasing beta value increases chance of a type II error.
The number needed to treat (NNT) represents the average number of patients who need to be treated before one patient experiences an outcome. For example, if the NNT = 4, then four patients must be treated on average before one patient has a positive response. This can also be expressed as 67% of all patients responding to therapy.
A confidence interval (CI) is used to estimate the true prevalence of disease within a population. It is calculated using the formula: CI = (a + zb) / (1 + z), where a is the lowest possible value, b is the highest possible value, z is the Z-score associated with the desired level of significance (e.g., 95% confidence interval corresponds to a Z-score of 1.96), and n is the sample size.
The relative risk (RR) compares the incidence rates between two groups. RR = Incidence rate in exposed group / Incidence rate in unexposed group.
The attributable risk (AR) estimates how many cases could be prevented if exposure were eliminated. AR = (Incidence rate in exposed group - Incidence rate in unexposed group) / Incidence rate in exposed group x 100.
The odds ratio (OR) measures the strength of association between exposure and disease. OR = Incidence rate in exposed group / Incidence rate in unexposed group.
The population attributable risk (PAR) estimates how many cases could be prevented if exposure were eliminated. PAR = (Incidence rate in exposed group - Incidence rate in unexposed group) / Incidence rate in exposed group x 100.
The sensitivity of a test refers to its ability to detect those individuals who actually possess the disease under investigation. Sensitivity = True positives / Total actual positives.
Specificity refers to the proportion of healthy persons who are correctly identified as not having the disease. Specificity = True negatives / Total expected negatives.
Positive predictive value (PPV) is defined as the percentage of people with a positive screening test result who truly have the disease. PPV = True positives / Total positive results.
Negative predictive value (NPV) is defined as the percentage of people with a negative screening test result who do not have the disease. NPV = True negatives / Total negative results.
The posttest probability (PTP) is the probability of having a particular condition after performing a test. PTP = Pretest probability x Likelihood ratio.
The likelihood ratio (LR) is the ratio of the probability of a positive test result given the presence of the disease to the probability of a positive test result given the absence of the disease. LR = Positive likelihood ratio / Negative likelihood ratio.
The Bayesian index (BI) is the probability of a positive test result given the disease times the probability of a positive test result given no disease plus the probability of a negative test result given the disease times the probability of a negative test result given no disease divided by the sum of these probabilities. BI = PL x TN / PL + FN.
The post-test probability (PTP) is the probability of having a particular condition after performing a test. PTP = Pretest probability x Likelihood ratio.
The prevalence rate is the number of existing cases per unit of population at any point in time.
The incidence rate is the number of newly developed cases per unit of population over a period of time.
The case fatality rate is the fraction of infected individuals dying from their illnesses. CFR = Deaths due to disease / Estimated number of cases of disease.
The five-year survival rate is the percentage of patients alive five years after diagnosis. Survival rate = Number of patients still living / Initial number of patients.
The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of data. Mean = Sum of individual observations / Number of observations.
The median is the ""middle"" observation when arranged in order of magnitude. Median = Midpoint of the ordered list of observations.
The mode is the most frequently occurring observation in a set of data. Mode = Most frequent observation.
The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of data. Range = Maximum - Minimum.
The variance is the average of the squared differences between each observation and the mean. Variance = (Sum of the squares of deviations) / (",Chance of a type II error
"A 78-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of severe neck pain. He rates the pain as a 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 scale. He denies any trauma but reports that he had been doing a lot of painting over the past week. He denies any radicular pain or numbness. Cervical range of motion is moderately limited in all fields. He is treated with articulatory springing technique. Four hours later the physician receives a call from the local emergency department, where the patient presented confused, nauseated, and vertiginous. The physician may be found liable if
the motion barrier was articulated more than 3 times or the motion barrier was met with a vectored force from the direction of ease or the neck was treated in simultaneous hyperrotation and extension or the patient was previously treated for osteoarthritis of the cervical spine.","### Answer: the motion barrier was met with a vectored force from the direction of ease
### Explanation: This case describes an elderly man who sustained a whiplash injury after being struck from behind while driving on the highway. Whiplash injuries occur when there is sudden hyperextension followed immediately by flexion (hyperflexion). Hyperextension causes stretching of the anterior longitudinal ligament and facet joint capsules; this results in laxity of the posterior elements of the vertebrae. Flexion then forces these structures into the intervertebral disc space, causing herniation of the nucleus pulposus through the annulus fibrosus. Injury to the cervical spinal cord can result in quadriplegia. Treatment consists of restoring normal alignment of the neck and preventing further motion. Articulatory springing techniques involve applying pressure against the head and neck to reduce the distance between the two. Springing involves moving the head toward the body until resistance is encountered. Once resistance is felt, the head is moved backward toward the chest. This process continues until full range of motion has been restored. If the motion barrier is met with a vectored force from the direction of ease, it may cause damage to the cervical spine.
The motion barrier must not be articulated more than three times because each time the motion barrier is articulated, the chance of damaging the cervical spine increases.
If the neck is treated in simultaneous hyperrotation and extension, the risk of damaging the cervical spine also increases.
Treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the cervical spine would require use of other modalities, including heat, electrical stimulation, ultrasound, and massage.
A chiropractic manipulative treatment (CMT) is defined as a high velocity low amplitude thrust applied to a specific joint. It is used primarily for the management of musculoskeletal disorders.

"A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease. It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug. A total of 600 individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial. Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?
Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer or Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer or Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer or Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer.","### Answer: Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
### Explanation: Relative risk = (Incidence among exposed)/(Incidence among non-exposed)x100= (100)/(100)x100= 1= No association between exposure to Drug X and incidence of cancer. RR= (100)/(40)= 2.5= Four times the risk of developing cancer if exposed to Drug X.

"A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-year history of chronic diarrhea and intermittent, crampy, lower abdominal pain. The pain is usually relieved with defecation and does not occur at night or interfere with sleep. She says she is frustrated by her symptoms and has stopped traveling because of her frequent, urgent need to use the bathroom. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. The lower abdomen is mildly tender to palpation; there is no rebound tenderness or guarding. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Antigliadin antibodies are not present. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Nefazodone or Nortriptyline or Phenelzine or Sertraline.","### Answer: Nortriptyline
### Explanation: This patient has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is characterized by recurrent abdominal discomfort associated with altered bowel habits that have been present for at least 3 months. Symptoms include anorectal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. There is no evidence of inflammation on physical examination. In this case, the predominant feature is chronic diarrhea. Diarrhea can be treated with tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine or nortriptyline. These drugs act via M3 muscarinic receptors and block voltage-dependent Na+ channels. They also increase intestinal transit time. Other options listed here would not treat the underlying cause of the problem.

"A study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches. Sixty children with chronic headaches are recruited for the study. In addition to their usual therapy, all children are treated with acupuncture three times a week for 2 months. Which of the following best describes this study design?
Case-control or Case series or Crossover or Cross-sectional.","### Answer: Case series
### Explanation: This case series was conducted on an exposed population (children with chronic headache). It does not have any control group and hence cannot determine causality.
A crossover trial would compare patients who receive treatment A versus those receiving treatment B; both groups would be followed over time.
In a cross-sectional study, data are collected from subjects at one point in time.
The cohort study involves identifying people who have been exposed to a risk factor and then observing them forward in time to see if they develop disease.
A randomized controlled trial compares intervention (e.g., acupuncture) with placebo (or no treatment), and both groups are compared over time.

Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no urticaria. Bilateral wheezing is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following types of drugs is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?
α1-Adrenergic agonist or α2-Adrenergic agonist or α1-Adrenergic antagonist or β2-Adrenergic agonist.","### Answer: β2-Adrenergic agonist
### Explanation: This patient had anaphylaxis from a bee sting. Epinephrine can reverse bronchospasm and hypotension associated with severe allergic reactions. It acts through both α and β adrenergic receptors; however, its primary effect is stimulation of β2 receptors. Alpha-adrenergic agonists would increase vasoconstriction and blood pressure. Adrenaline is contraindicated in patients with heart disease because it causes tachycardia, hypertension, and arrhythmias. α2-Adrenergic agonists cause sedation and vasodilation. These effects could worsen hypotension. α1-Adrenergic antagonists block the peripheral effects of epinephrine. They have little central nervous system activity and thus cannot treat symptoms of anxiety.
About option d: Salbutamol is used in asthma treatment. However, it does not cross the blood brain barrier and therefore cannot relieve neurogenic symptoms of anaphylactic shock.
About option c: Prazosin is an α1-selective antihypertensive drug that blocks peripheral vascular resistance. It is also used in benign prostatic hyperplasia.
About option b: Clonidine is an α2-selective antihypertensive agent that decreases sympathetic outflow. It is useful in hypertension management.
About option e: Terbutaline is a selective β2-receptor agonist indicated for preterm labor.
About option f: Phentolamine is an α1-selective adrenergic blocking agent used in erectile dysfunction.
Key Concept:
Epinephrine is the first line therapy for anaphylactic shock.

"Five years after being shot in the right thigh, a 21-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar. At the time of the initial wound, he was discharged after 6 hours of observation with no fractures or soft-tissue swelling. A loud murmur is heard on auscultation; there is a thrill. He has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Arterial spasm or Arteriovenous fistula or Deep venous thrombosis or Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.","### Answer: Arteriovenous fistula
### Explanation: This patient had an injury that damaged the deep femoral artery and its accompanying vein. Injury to the artery results in formation of an arteriovenous (AV) shunt between the injured artery and the intact vein. AV malformations can be congenital or acquired from trauma. They usually present later in life when they become symptomatic due to high blood flow through them. Symptoms include pulsatile abnormalities, bruits, bruit sounds, cyanosis, and hematuria. If left untreated, these lesions have a risk of rupture into surrounding tissues or into the vascular system. Treatment consists of ligation of the proximal end of the affected vessel followed by embolization of the distal portion.
Diagnosis: Arteriovenous fistula
Symptoms: Pulsatile abnormality, bruits, cyanosis, hematuria
Physical examination findings: Murmur, thrill
Treatment: Ligation of the proximal end of the affected vessel followed by embolization of the distal portion
Other options:
Option A: Arterial spasm does not cause a thrill. It would produce a systolic pressure surge.
Option D: Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery causes pain in the calf upon walking downstairs but not a thrill.
Option E: Varicosities are associated with reflux of venous blood backward toward the heart.
Key concept: Traumatic AV malformation presents many years after the original event.

",Arteriovenous fistula
"A previously healthy 40-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of constant substernal chest pain for 12 hours that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration. The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward. There is no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues?
Aortic intima or Esophageal sphincter or Myocardium or Pericardium.","### Answer: Pericardium
### Explanation: Acute pericarditis can be caused by viruses, bacteria, trauma, or idiopathically. It presents with retrosternal pain radiating to the neck and shoulders, pleuritic character, and aggravated by deep breathing and lying down. Inflammation of the myocardial wall would present with symptoms of acute MI. Traumatic rupture of the esophagus could lead to pneumomediastinum but not pericarditis. Ruptured aorta would result in hemopericardium, shock, and hypotension.
Infective endocarditis usually involves the valves; however, it can also involve the ventricular walls.
Diagnosis: Acute pericarditis
Treatment: NSAIDs, colchicine, aspirin
Complications: Constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade
Also Know
Acute pericarditis is associated with systemic diseases like SLE, RA, ankylosing spondylitis, and Behcet syndrome.
The classic presentation of acute pericarditis includes sharp, stabbing, retrosternal pain that worsens on inspiration and when leaning forward. This pain often mimics angina. However, unlike anginal pain, the pain of pericarditis does not radiate to the arm.
Pericarditis is commonly seen after upper respiratory tract infections, especially influenza.
Most cases resolve within several weeks.
If there is evidence of concomitant inflammatory disorder, treatment with glucocorticoids is indicated.
Colchicine has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms and prevent recurrences.
NSAIDs have anti-inflammatory properties and provide analgesia.
Antibiotics are used if infectious etiology is suspected.
Electrocardiogram (ECG):
ST segment elevations are noted in V1–V6 and I and aVL.
There is T wave inversion in V5–V6.
No Q waves are evident.
Chest X-ray: Normal.
CT scan: No abnormalities.
Cardiac enzymes: Negative.
ECHO: Normal.
Blood cultures: Positive.
ESR: Elevated.
CRP: Elevated.
Serum creatinine kinase: Elevated.
Myocyte-specific antigen: Elevated.
Urinary antinuclear antibody: Positive.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy: Normal.
Coronary angiography: Normal.

"A 24-year-old man comes to the office because of a 2-day history of a red, itchy rash on his buttocks and legs. Four days ago, he returned from a cruise to the Caribbean, during which he swam in the ship’s pool and used the hot tub. He appears well. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows the findings in the photograph. The infectious agent causing these findings most likely began to proliferate in which of the following locations?
Apocrine gland or Dermis or Eccrine gland or Hair follicle.","### Answer: Apocrine gland
### Explanation: This patient has impetigo contagiosa caused by group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes). These organisms colonize the skin after entering through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes. They then spread along lymphatics to reach apocrine sweat glands, where they multiply and cause local inflammation. Impetigo usually presents as vesicular lesions that rupture to form crusty superficial lesions. It can also present as bullae containing clear fluid. In this case, the lesion was not bullous; therefore, option B is incorrect. Option C would be correct if the lesion were pus-filled. Options D and E are not involved in the pathogenesis of this condition.

"A 15-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of painless swelling in the left testicle that has varied in size over the past several months. There is no history of trauma. The lesion transilluminates well, and no inguinal nodes are palpable. Findings from a testicular scan are normal. The most appropriate management includes
injection with a sclerosing agent or needle aspiration or needle biopsy or surgical repair.","### Answer: injection with a sclerosing agent
### Explanation: Injection of tetracycline hydrochloride into the scrotum can be used to treat varicoceles. This treatment is not effective when the veins have become competent enough to shunt blood through the lumen of the testis. Varicocele is usually seen on the left side but can occur bilaterally. It is associated with infertility (40%), hypogonadism (67%), and cryptorchidism (8%). Treatment options include observation if the patient desires pregnancy, embolization, ligation, and orchidopexy.
Varicosities within the substance of the testes are called pampiniform venous plexus. They are often asymptomatic and require no treatment unless they cause symptoms. If there is an acute thrombosis, then the patient needs immediate attention because of the possibility of renal failure due to retrograde propagation of clot up the IVC.
A varicocele is easily diagnosed clinically; however, it must be differentiated from a solid tumor. Ultrasound examination is useful in this regard. Biopsies are contraindicated because of the risk of seeding malignant cells throughout the body.
The incidence of testicular cancer increases dramatically during adolescence. Testicular neoplasms account for approximately 95% of all primary testicular tumors. Germ cell tumors constitute 95% of these cases. Seminomas comprise 50%, while nonseminoma accounts for 45%. Nonseminoma consists of embryonal carcinoma (25%), yolk sac tumor (20%), choriocarcinoma (10%), teratomas (10%), endodermal sinus tumor (5%), and mixed germ cell tumors (10%).
Seminomas tend to metastasize slowly, whereas nonseminomas spread rapidly. Metastases typically involve the regional lymph nodes first. Lung metastasis occurs late in the course of disease.
Treatment of seminomas involves radiotherapy followed by radical inguinal orchiectomy. Radiation therapy is also indicated after incomplete resection of non-seminoma. Chemotherapy is recommended for patients who present with advanced stage disease. Patients whose tumors express alpha fetoprotein respond better to chemotherapy.
Chemotherapeutic agents commonly used against testicular tumors include bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, vinblastine, and dactinomycin.
Patients with residual masses after chemotherapy and radiation therapy are candidates for high-dose chemotherapy using autologous stem cells.
Testicular feminization syndrome is characterized by gynecomastia, absence of secondary sexual characteristics, and amenorrhea. These individuals have a female karyotype and ovarian structures in place of the testicles.

"A 10-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 4-day history of fever and cough. His illness began with lowgrade fever and copious, clear nasal discharge. Two days ago he developed a moist, nonproductive cough and rapid breathing. He has received all scheduled childhood immunizations. He attends a large day-care center and has three schoolaged siblings. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 38/min, and blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows nasal flaring and rhinorrhea. Chest examination shows intercostal retractions along with bilateral, diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi. The infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has which of the following properties?
DNA genome or Double-stranded nucleic acid genome or Mature virion lacking viral polymerase or Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein.","### Answer: DNA genome
### Explanation: This patient has an acute exacerbation of asthma caused by parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV). PIV causes up to half of all pediatric hospital admissions due to bronchitis and pneumonia. It also accounts for nearly two thirds of cases of croup. Infection occurs through contact with secretions from infected individuals. Viruses have single-stranded RNAs or double-stranded DNAs that encode their own replication enzyme. They enter cells by endocytosis and fuse with lysosomes, releasing the viral genetic material into the cytoplasm. The mature virion lacks viral polymerase; therefore, it cannot cause reinfection after recovery. Fusion proteins mediate attachment between host and virus but not cell entry. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins found on influenza viruses.

"A 29-year-old woman is prescribed carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia. She has a strong family history of osteoporosis. As a result, the physician also advises her to increase her intake of vitamin D. The most likely reason for this recommendation is that carbamazepine may affect which of the following pharmacokinetic processes?
Absorption or Distribution or Excretion or Metabolism.","### Answer: Absorption
### Explanation: Carbamazepine can decrease calcium absorption and cause hypercalcemia. Calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated through several mechanisms including dietary intake, bone resorption, parathyroid hormone secretion, and renal excretion. Increasing the amount of calcium taken up from the gut requires an active process involving calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D). Thus, if there is decreased intestinal uptake of calcium due to drug interference with vitamin D metabolism, then it would be wise to supplement with additional amounts of vitamin D. This does not involve changes in distribution, elimination, or metabolism.
Option B: No change in distribution occurs because the drug remains bound to plasma proteins.
Option C: There is no effect on excretion; the kidneys simply clear the drug unchanged.
Option D: The drug undergoes hepatic oxidative degradation.

"A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?
G0 or G1 or G2 or M.","### Answer: G2
### Explanation: Increased levels of cyclin D cause uncontrolled progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This results from loss of function of the Rb protein due to mutations that prevent its phosphorylation. Mutations in the TP53 gene lead to increased levels of cyclins B and E, resulting in decreased time spent in the G2 checkpoint. Cyclin A causes premature entry into mitosis, where it interacts with CDK2. Overexpression of cyclin E leads to overactivation of CDK4/6 complexes, thereby causing early entry into S phase.

Option A: G0 - No cell division occurs during resting state; thus, no control needed.
Option B: G1 - Cell cycle regulation occurs here, but not affected by p53 mutation.
Option C: G2 - Controlled by p53, but if there is a mutation, then control is lost.
Option D: M - DNA replication does not occur until after chromosomal duplication has occurred.

"A male stillborn is delivered at 32 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination of the stillborn shows the absence of a urethral opening. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this stillborn?
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia or Intralobar sequestration or Pulmonary hypoplasia or Situs inversus.","### Answer: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
### Explanation: Prune belly syndrome (triad of urinary tract abnormalities, cryptorchidism, and muscular hypoplasia) can be associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernias. These patients have an absent urethra due to failure of development of the prostatic urethra. Abdominal wall defects occur because of incomplete fusion of the pleuroperitoneal membranes during embryogenesis. Other anomalies include renal agenesis, bladder exstrophy, and hypospadiasis. Intralobar sequestrations are not associated with prune belly syndrome. Pulmonary hypoplasia occurs when there is a deficiency of amnion cells that form the pulmonary bud. This results in persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus. Situs inversus does not cause urinary tract malformations.

""Prune Belly Syndrome -",Pulmonary hypoplasia
"A couple comes for preconceptional genetic counseling because they both have a family history of α-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration. Genetic studies show a single gene deletion. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. If the two-gene deletion is in trans (one deletion on the maternal gene and one deletion on the paternal gene), which of the following percentages of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion?
0% or 25% or 50% or 75%.","### Answer: 50%
### Explanation: In autosomal recessive disorders, if both parents carry the same mutant allele, each child receives one normal allele from each parent and one abnormal allele from each parent. Therefore, there is no phenotype in either parent but 25% of children will be homozygous recessive and express the disease. However, when both parents carry different mutations, each child can inherit two copies of the same mutated alleles (in cis) or two mutated alleles that are on separate chromosomes (trans). When this occurs, half of the children will receive two mutated alleles and therefore will manifest the disease.

She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Skeletal survey or Echocardiography or Bone scan or MRI of the shoulder.","### Answer: Echocardiography
### Explanation: This child has Marfan syndrome, which is characterized by tall stature (>98th percentile), long extremities, arachnodactyly, and hyperflexible joints. In addition, there can be cardiovascular involvement, including mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilatation, and dissection. The risk of sudden death from aortic dissection increases markedly if the aorta reaches >4 cm in diameter. Therefore, echocardiographic screening is recommended every year between ages 10 and 25 years. Surgical repair of the aorta is indicated when the ascending aorta measures >4 cm in diameter.
The skeletal survey would not reveal any abnormality except perhaps scoliosis, but it would not confirm the diagnosis.
Bone scans could demonstrate bony defects due to fractures, but they would not help establish the diagnosis.
MRI of the shoulder would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
A CT scan would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
An electromyogram would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
Genetic testing would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
A VDRL test would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
An angiogram would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
An exercise stress test would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
An electrocardiogram would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
A fluorescein angiogram would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
A lumbar puncteref would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.
A muscle biopsy would not provide information regarding the diagnosis.

"A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8-week history of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs 20 to 30 minutes after eating. The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula; it lasts about 30 minutes and is not relieved by antacids. The last episode occurred after she ate a hamburger and french fries. She has not had vomiting. She is currently asymptomatic. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2 . Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant or Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through or CT scan of the abdomen or Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.","### Answer: Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant
### Explanation: This patient has symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis can be caused by gallstones, alcohol consumption, hypercalcemia, trauma, drugs, and hereditary factors. It is associated with elevated serum amylase levels but normal lipase levels. Ultrasound examination of the right upper quadrant would show characteristic changes of pancreatitis. An endoscopy could reveal duodenal stones causing obstruction and subsequent inflammation of the pancreas. An ERCP would confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis and also allow therapeutic drainage of bile ducts if necessary. A CT scan of the abdomen would provide better visualization of the pancreas and surrounding structures compared to USG but would require intravenous contrast administration.
A plain X-ray of the abdomen would only demonstrate calcifications within the pancreas.
Diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis
Treatment: Supportive care including analgesics, fluids, and nasogastric suctioning
Drugs used include morphine, nonopioid opiates, ketorolac, metoclopramide, octreotide, somatostatin, and pentagastrin
In severe cases, total parenteral nutrition may be required
Antibiotics are indicated when there is evidence of secondary peripancreatic infection
Pancreatic necrosis requires surgical debridement
The mortality rate ranges between 5% and 15%.
Complications include pseudocyst formation, abscesses, pancreatic ascites, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and sepsis.

"A 22-year-old male presents to the office with a 5-day history of diarrhea after completing his third course of antibiotics for mastoiditis. Physical examination reveals vague generalized abdominal pain on palpation. Culture on hektoen enteric agar is positive. The most likely etiologic agent causing the diarrhea is
Clostridium difficile or Entamoeba histolytica or Giardia lamblia or Salmonella typhi.","### Answer: Clostridium difficile
### Explanation: C. difficile causes pseudomembranous colitis (PMC), which can be life threatening if not treated promptly and appropriately. PMC occurs when there has been recent use of broad spectrum antibiotics that alter the normal flora of the colon. This results in overgrowth of C. difficile, which produces two major exotoxins (A and B). These toxins cause inflammation and necrosis of the mucosa resulting in formation of an ulcerative membrane. Patients present with fever, crampy abdominal pain, watery nonbloody diarrhea, and sometimes bloody stools. Diagnosis is made by demonstrating the organism from fecal specimens or by detecting its cytotoxin in the stool. Treatment consists of discontinuing offending agents, administration of metronidazole or vancomycin, and supportive care.
Entamoeba histolytica does not produce any toxins; it invades the intestinal epithelial cells and causes hemorrhagic colitis. It also causes invasive amoebiasis characterized by liver abscesses.
Giardia lamblia is a flagellate protozoan parasite that lives within the duodenum and jejunum. Infection usually follows ingestion of contaminated water containing trophozoites. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.
Salmonella typhi is a gram negative bacillus that causes salmonellosis. It enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract and then spreads via bloodstream to various organs including spleen, kidneys, adrenals, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and brain.
Diagnosis is confirmed by isolating the organism from the patient’s feces or urine.
Treatment involves using fluoroquinolones or ceftriaxone.
Supportive therapy includes fluid replacement, electrolyte replenishment, and antidiarrheal medications.

"A 15-year-old male is brought to the office with a 2-day history of painful swelling over the sacral prominence that began after a fall during a high school wrestling match. The patient has a low-grade fever. Examination reveals an erythematous, fluctuant, elevated mass with 3 midline pores. Rectal examination reveals no induration or pain. The most likely diagnosis is
anocutaneous fistula or coccygodynia or hidradenitis suppurativa or pilonidal abscess.","### Answer: pilonidal abscess
### Explanation: Pilonidal disease refers to chronic inflammation and scarring associated with hair follicles near the gluteal cleft. Abscess formation occurs when there is obstruction of the sinus tracts. Patients usually present with symptoms of localized pain, pruritus, redness, and tenderness. Treatment consists of incision and drainage followed by excision of all sinuses and granulomatous tissue.
Anocutaneous fistulas are abnormal connections between the rectum and skin. They can be caused by Crohn’s disease, radiation therapy, trauma, surgery, or spontaneously. Symptoms include anal discharge, odor, bleeding, itching, and pain. Diagnosis is made by proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Treatment includes topical antibiotics, sitz baths, and application of petroleum jelly. Fistulas must be treated endoscopically if possible; otherwise, they require surgical closure.
Coccygodynia (tailbone syndrome) results from injury to the coccyx. It presents with pain on sitting down, which improves upon standing up. There is no treatment except bed rest and antiinflammatory medications.
Hidradenitis suppurativa is characterized by recurrent abscesses in intertriginous areas. It is thought to result from blockages within apocrine glands. Treatment involves long courses of systemic antibiotic therapy combined with intralesional steroid injection. Surgical debridement is often necessary.
Pseudomonas dermatitis is a bacterial infection of the perianal area that follows exposure to contaminated water. It presents with severe pain, edema, and purple lesions. Treatment requires intravenous antibiotics and warm sitz baths.

A",pilonidal abscess
"You are visiting an 86-year-old woman in her home at the request of the patient's daughter because of worsening shortness of breath at rest for the past 2 days. The patient is confined to her home because of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale. She was discharged 1 week ago from the hospital following 3 weeks of treatment for pneumonia that required intubation; her hospital stay was complicated by sepsis. She had a prolonged weaning program from intubation. Prior to discharge, the patient and her daughter met with you to review the patient's advance directive. During the discussion, the patient said, ""I'd rather die than be intubated again."" At that time, both the patient and her daughter signed an addendum to that effect on the patient's advance directive. Today, the patient is dyspneic and is unable to complete a sentence. Vital signs are temperature 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 35/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84% while the patient is breathing 4 L of oxygen. You ask the patient if she wishes to return to the hospital. She says, ""No, I want to die at home."" Her daughter takes you aside and says, ""My mother doesn't know what she's saying. I insist that she be admitted to the hospital."" After further discussion with the daughter regarding support available at home, which of the following is the most appropriate step?
Admit the patient to the hospital or Arrange for consultation with a home hospice team or Consult with the hospital ethics committee or Order a home continuous positive airway pressure machine and instruct the daughter in its use.","### Answer: Admit the patient to the hospital
### Explanation: This case illustrates the complexity surrounding end-of-life decision making. Although the patient has expressed a desire not to be reintubated, this wish does not necessarily apply when the patient becomes critically ill. In addition, family members can have conflicting views regarding their loved ones’ care. If there is no clear documentation of the patient’s preferences, then healthcare providers must rely upon surrogate decision makers who often disagree with each other. When patients become seriously ill, it is important to involve all parties involved in the decision-making process early on. It is also essential to document these discussions clearly and accurately. In this instance, the patient did sign an addendum to her advance directive stating that she would refuse any future intubation attempts. However, the patient herself cannot make decisions now due to her confusion. Therefore, the best course of action is to admit the patient to the hospital where she can receive aggressive therapy including mechanical ventilation if necessary. A home continuous positive airway pressure machine could provide adequate oxygenation but would require close monitoring and frequent adjustment. Home hospice teams focus on providing comfort measures only and would not address the acute condition. Consultation with the hospital ethics committee might help resolve conflicts between the patient’s daughter and the physician, but ultimately the decision remains up to the treating provider.
Key Concept:
The patient’s documented advance directives take precedence over those of the family member.
Content:
In this scenario, the patient has been treated for community acquired pneumonia and developed ARDS requiring intubation. Now she is recovering well enough to breathe spontaneously and wants to go back home. But she is confused and her daughter thinks that she is not able to decide. So she wants to keep her mom in ICU till she gets better.
Physicians need to respect the autonomy of patients even though they are unconscious or delirious. They should follow the advance directives mentioned in the chart.
If the patient has not made any advance directives, then the decision lies with the next of kin.
But here the patient has already made an advanced directive and hence the decision lies with the doctor.
Treatment plan:
As per the patient’s preference, he should be sent home after educating his wife how to manage him at home. He needs supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. His diet should be high calorie and protein rich. He should avoid smoking and alcohol.
He should be advised to get vaccinated against flu every year.
His vitals should be monitored regularly.
He should be followed up periodically.
Complications:
Pulmonary embolism
Residual hypoxemia
Atelectasis
Recurrent pneumonia
Cardiac arrhythmias
Conclusion:
Patient autonomy should always be respected. Next of kin should be informed about the status of the patient and the plan of management. Advance directives should be updated whenever possible.

"A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain. She describes the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 9 days, she has had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She does not smoke. Her husband and children have had no recent illness. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Examination shows congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. There is tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. The tympanic membranes are normal, and there is no erythema of the throat. Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?
Haemophilus influenzae type b or Moraxella catarrhalis or Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae.","### Answer: Haemophilus influenzae type b
### Explanation: Acute ethmoiditis can be caused by H. influenzae type B, S. pneumoniae, or M. catarrhalis. Patients typically present with unilateral headache, nasal stuffiness, and fever. Purulent nasal discharge and swelling of the ipsilateral eyelid may also occur. In contrast to acute frontal sinusitis, which presents with pressure over the involved ophthalmic division of the fifth cranial nerve, acute ethmoiditis usually causes referred pain to the distribution of the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Unlike acute maxillary sinusitis, where percussion of the affected side produces dullness but no transillumination, acute ethmoiditis results in diminished light transmission through the infected maxilla. Treatment includes antibiotics directed against the offending pathogen.
Diagnosis: Ethmoiditis
Physiology: Maxillary Sinuses
Pathology: Paranasal Sinuses
Anatomy: Nasal Cavity
Key Concept:
Acute ethmoiditis can be caused by H. influenzae type B, S. pneumoniae, or M. catarrhalis.

"A 42-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 10 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she has shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Her pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are decreased at the left lung base. An x-ray of the chest shows opacification of the left lower lung field with loss of the diaphragmatic shadow. Placement of a chest tube yields a small amount of air followed by greenish fluid. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
CT scan of the abdomen or CT scan of the chest or Thoracoscopy or Laparotomy.","### Answer: CT scan of the chest
### Explanation: This patient sustained blunt trauma to the thorax that resulted in pneumothorax and hemothorax. She also had an associated rib fracture. The initial treatment consisted of placing a chest tube through which air and then fluid were evacuated from the pleural space. The next step would be to determine if there is any ongoing bleeding into the pleural cavity. If this is not the case, then the chest tube can be removed. However, if active bleeding persists, then further intervention is necessary. Intrapleural hemorrhage can lead to hypovolemic shock and death unless it is controlled promptly. Therefore, the next step in her care would be to obtain a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest to assess the extent of injury to the lungs and surrounding structures. If no other injuries are present, then the chest tube could be reinserted. If significant vascular injury is found, then laparotomy would be indicated.
A CT scan of the abdomen is unlikely to reveal any additional information regarding the source of the intrapleural bleeding.
Thoracoscopy might allow direct visualization of the injured vessels but requires specialized equipment and expertise.
The diaphragm is likely damaged because of its close proximity to the affected area; however, repairing the diaphragm is not part of the immediate plan of action.
Placement of a second chest tube would only serve to provide another means of drainage until definitive therapy is instituted.
Diagnosis: Hemothorax, pneumothorax
Ref: Robbins Basic Pathology, Kumar, Abbas, AsterJaypee Brothers Medical Publishers Pvt Ltd, page 796
 
Key Concept:
Chest X ray is done to confirm the diagnosis of pneumothorax.
Treatment includes insertion of a large bore needle (chest tube) under local anaesthesia.
If the pneumothorax is small enough, it may resolve spontaneously.
Large pneumothoraces require urgent surgical decompression.
Intrathoracic haemorrhage must be treated immediately.

Option B - Chest X Ray showing pneumothorax
Option C - Thoracoscopy
Option D - Laprotomy
Option E - Second chest tube placement
Option F - Diaphragm repair
Option G - Abdominal CT Scan

"A 19-year-old woman who is a regular patient comes to the office for her annual physical examination and cervical cytology. She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months. She is a college student who is in good health, has not had any medical illnesses or surgery, and has never been pregnant. She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception. She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6 months ago. She also notes that she has gained about 9 kg (20 lb) in the past 6 months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen. She has been somewhat depressed about this, and her grades have declined. She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married. Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen, and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries. This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following?
Androgen-producing ovarian tumor or Cushing syndrome or Hypothyroidism or Polycystic ovarian syndrome.","### Answer: Polycystic ovarian syndrome
### Explanation: Although polycystic ovarian disease can be associated with virilization from excessive production of adrenocorticoids, it does not usually present with features of hyperandrogenemia unless there is coexisting adrenal neoplasia. In contrast, patients with Cushing syndrome often develop hirsutism due to increased levels of testosterone produced by the adrenals. Patients with hypothyroidism tend to gain weight but rarely experience amenorrhea. Androgen-secreting ovarian tumors produce estrogens rather than androgens and cause endometrial hyperplasia and menorrhagia rather than amenorrhea. PCOD is characterized by chronic anovulation secondary to failure of ovary to respond normally to gonadotropins. It is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, leading to peripheral conversion of androgens into estrogens. These factors lead to development of symptoms like hirsutism, alopecia, infertility, and obesity.
Diagnosis: Polycystic ovarian syndrome
Symptom: Obesity
Physical Examination Findings: Acne, Hirsutism
Lab Investigations: Hyperinsulinemia
Clinical Course: Chronic anovulation
Treatment: Metformin, Clomiphene citrate
Other Options:
Androgen producing ovarian tumor - Virilisation
Hypothyroidism - Weight gain
Cushing’s syndrome - Weight gain
Polycystic Ovarian Disease

It is a common disorder affecting women of reproductive age group.
The main clinical manifestations include chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenemia, and obesity.
In addition, many patients complain of irregular menses, infertility, and cosmetic problems related to hirsutism and acne.
Pathophysiologically, PCOD results from complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors.
PCOD is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, leading to peripheral conversion of androgens into estrogens.
These factors lead to development of symptoms like hirsutism, alopecia, infertility, and obesity.

Key Concept:
Patient presents with complaints of obesity, acne, hirsutism and irregular periods.
She gives a positive family history of similar presentation among other females in her family.
Her USG reveals bilateral multiple follicular cysts in the ovaries.
All these findings point towards diagnosis of PCOD.

",Polycystic ovarian syndrome
"A 44-year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of a lump on her neck that she noted 1 week ago. She denies any tenderness, fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination reveals a 2-cm freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid. In addition to thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is
a nuclear thyroid scan or an iodine131 scan or fine-needle aspiration or ultrasonography of the thyroid gland.","### Answer: fine-needle aspiration
### Explanation: Fine needle aspirate (FNA) cytology is the investigation of choice in patients presenting with solitary nodules of the thyroid. FNAs have a sensitivity of approximately 90% for malignant disease and can be used to determine if surgery is indicated. Thyroid scanning has no role in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer but is useful when considering total thyroidectomy. Ultrasound imaging is also not diagnostic; however, it does allow for better localization of suspicious areas within the thyroid gland. It is particularly valuable in young women who often have multiple small nodular masses within their thyroid glands.
A nuclear thyroid scan would show increased uptake in metastatic disease, which is unlikely in this case because there is no evidence of distant spread. Iodine131scans are performed after treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma to detect residual tissue. They are not used for screening purposes.
Diagnosis: Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid
Laboratory assessment
Thyroid function tests
Serum TSH
Free T4

"A 22-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3-day history of cold symptoms and a 1-week history of progressive fatigue. Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected. In addition, this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents?
Adenovirus or BK virus or Epstein-Barr virus or Herpes simplex virus.","### Answer: Epstein-Barr virus
### Explanation: EBV causes infectious mononucleosis; it can also cause posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), especially when patients receive immunosuppressants other than calcineurin inhibitors. PTLD occurs in up to 5% of liver recipients within 6 months of transplantation. It presents with fevers, weight loss, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Treatment consists of withdrawal of offending drugs, chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy. Patients who develop PTLD usually die within 4–8 weeks if untreated.
The other viruses listed are not associated with PTLD.
Diagnosis: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder
""Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders""
Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) occur frequently in children but less often in adults. They present with fever, weight loss, splenomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy. These tumors arise from B cells and express surface IgM and CD20. Most cases are caused by EBV infection. Other viruses implicated include human herpesvirus 8, Cytomegalovirus, and HIV.
Patients who develop PTLD usually die within 4–8 weeks if untreated. Treatment involves withdrawal of offending drugs, chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy.
In contrast to solid organ transplants, where the incidence of PTLD has decreased dramatically since the introduction of tacrolimus, its incidence remains high among bone marrow transplant recipients.

"A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of intermittent blood in his stool. He has had no pain with defecation. Physical examination shows a 1-cm, visible anal mass located below the dentate line. A biopsy of the mass is scheduled. If the mass if found to be malignant, it is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes for possible metastasis?
Internal iliac or Popliteal or Sacral or Superficial inguinal.","### Answer: Internal iliac
### Explanation: Malignancies that arise from the anorectum (including the rectosigmoid colon and anus), including carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, sarcomas, and others, can spread hematogenously to regional lymph nodes. These include internal iliac, obturator, presacral, paraaortic, and common iliac lymph nodes. Lymphatic drainage from these sites follows the inferior mesenteric veins into the left side of the abdomen. Rectal cancer rarely metastasizes to supraclavicular lymph nodes. Supraclavicular lymph node involvement would suggest lung or breast primary tumors.

"A study is being conducted to assess mesothelioma in shipyard workers. A large shipyard firm has provided the asbestos exposure records of all employees during the past 50 years. The health insurer for the workers has provided claims data that documents all chest x-rays and diagnoses of mesothelioma among current workers and retirees. The study enrolled shipyard workers who were diagnosed with mesothelioma and shipyard workers who were not diagnosed with mesothelioma. All subjects in the study had to have chest xrays. Which of the following is the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays?
Address confounding or Demonstrate causality or Minimize ascertainment bias or Reduce recall bias.","### Answer: Address confounding
### Explanation: Confounding can be addressed through matching (either propensity score matching or exact matching). Matching involves identifying a subset of exposed persons who resemble unexposed persons in terms of their characteristics except for exposure status. This helps reduce selection bias. In this case, it would involve finding a set of nonasbestos-exposed workers whose demographics match those of the patients with mesothelioma. Ascertainment bias refers to systematic errors in the measurement of disease incidence rates due to differences between cases included in the analysis and cases excluded from the analysis. It occurs when there are different criteria used to determine which people get screened versus which ones don't. For example, if only symptomatic individuals receive chest x-rays, then you might miss early asymptomatic cases of mesothelioma. Recall bias occurs when participants remember events differently over time. If the outcome is rare, then any difference in recollection could lead to an incorrect conclusion regarding risk factors. Differences in outcomes based on treatment assignment cannot demonstrate causality because they represent confounding variables rather than true effects of interventions. Ref :Park 23rd edition Pgno : 79
Confounding factor
A confounder is defined as ""a variable that is associated both with exposure and with disease.""
In other words, a confounder must meet three conditions:

It must be related to both exposure and outcome.
Its relationship to exposure must be independent of its relationship to outcome.
The effect size of the confounder on the outcome must be sufficient to alter the association between exposure and outcome.

If these conditions are met, we say that the confounder is ""associated"" with either the exposure or the outcome; otherwise, we call it a ""third factor"".

For example, consider a cohort study examining the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Suppose that alcohol consumption is also strongly correlated with both smoking and lung cancer. Then, if we fail to control for alcohol use, our results may appear biased toward no association between smoking and lung cancer, even though there actually is an increased risk. Alcohol use is therefore called a confounder.

Note that a third factor does not necessarily need to be measured. Even if we do not measure alcohol use, but simply assume that heavy drinkers tend to smoke less and live longer, then the apparent protective effect of smoking against lung cancer may still be spurious.

Similarly, a confounder does not need to be distributed equally across groups. For instance, suppose that women are more likely than men to develop breast cancer, and that estrogen levels are higher in women than in men. Then, if we examine the relationship between estrogen replacement therapy and breast cancer in postmenopausal women, we may find that estrogen replacement therapy appears to increase the risk of breast cancer. However, this result may be entirely spurious, since estrogen levels themselves are responsible for the observed correlation. Estrogen level is thus a confounder.

Finally, note that a confounder need not be a person. For instance, seasonality may affect both the exposure and the outcome. Thus, if we wish to investigate the relationship between influenza vaccination and pneumonia, we may find that the apparent benefit of vaccination disappears after controlling for season. Season itself is thus a confounder.

Confounding is often confused with reverse causation. In particular, many researchers believe that reverse causation implies confounding. However, this is not always the case. Consider the following two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Smoking causes lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer quit smoking before receiving chemotherapy.
Scenario 2: Lung cancer causes smoking cessation. Patients with lung cancer stop smoking before receiving chemotherapy.

In Scenario 1, quitting smoking reduces the risk of developing lung cancer. Therefore, if we compare the survival rate of lung cancer patients who stopped smoking to those who did not stop smoking, we may conclude that stopping smoking improves survival. However, this conclusion is false, since the patients who stopped smoking already developed lung cancer. In contrast, in Scenario 2, quitting smoking increases the risk of developing lung cancer. Therefore, if we compare the survival rate of lung cancer patients who stopped smoking to those who did not stop smoking, we may conclude that continuing to smoke improves survival. However, this conclusion is false, since the patients who continued to smoke already died of lung cancer.

Thus, while reverse causation implies",Minimize ascertainment bias
"A 34-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3- to 4-week history of swelling of her legs and a 9-kg (20-lb) weight gain. Medical history is significant for sickle cell trait and mild anemia. She has been taking 800 mg of ibuprofen three times daily for Achilles tendinitis diagnosed 1 month ago. She has smoked five cigarettes daily for the past 15 years, and she drinks one to five beers on weekends. She experimented with cocaine briefly 16 years ago, but she has never used intravenous drugs. She has been in a monogamous sexual relationship for the past 12 years. Today, vital signs are temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses periorbital edema but no jugular venous distention. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination discloses an S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination discloses bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion. Examination of the lower extremities shows pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally. Results of which of the following studies are most likely to be abnormal in this patient?
HIV antibody study or Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration or Toxicology screening of the urine or Urine protein concentration.","### Answer: Toxicology screening of the urine
### Explanation: This young woman presents with symptoms consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Nephritic syndromes present with hematuria, azotemia, and hypeension; they can also cause peripheral edema. In contrast, nephrotic syndromes typically have massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and lipiduria. Proteinuria >3 g/d is diagnostic of nephrotic syndrome. Ibuprofen use could contribute to renal damage if there were underlying disease processes that predisposed patients to kidney injury. However, it does not explain the sudden development of nephrotic syndrome. Cocaine intoxication causes vasoconstriction, leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate and increased intrarenal pressure. It can lead to acute tubular necrosis, papillary necrosis, and chronic interstitial nephritis. Chronic interstitial nephritis leads to fibrosis and sclerosis of the glomeruli, resulting in reduced GFR. Patients who develop nephropathy due to cocaine use often recover completely after stopping drug use. Diabetes insipidus would result in polyuria rather than oligouria. Hypertensive crisis would manifest with elevated blood pressures, headaches, nausea, vomiting, visual changes, and seizures. Renovascular disease results in renovascular hypertension, which usually occurs over many months to several years. Acute glomerulonephritis is characterized by red cells casts in the urinary sediment.
The other choices are unlikely to be associated with nephrotic syndrome.

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?
Acyclovir or Imiquimod or Levofloxacin or Metronidazole.","### Answer: Imiquimod
### Explanation: This patient has symptoms consistent with condyloma acuminata (genital warts). These benign neoplasms arise from human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. They can cause pruritis, irritability, and pain during sexual activity. In addition, they can increase risk of cervical cancer due to co-infection with high-risk strains of HPV. Condyloma acuminata usually appears within 3 weeks after exposure to HPV; however, it can take up to 8 months before clinical presentation. Treatment options include cryosurgery, electrocautery, laser vaporization, trichloroacetic acid application, imiquimod cream, podophyllotoxin solution, and surgical excision. Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that stimulates production of cytokines involved in cellular immunity. It is approved for treatment of external genital warts. Podophyllotoxin is a plant extract used topically to treat genital warts. It works by causing DNA damage through crosslinking of double helices. It is effective against HPV type 6 and 11. Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue that selectively blocks replication of HSV and VZV. It is useful only when these organisms are present. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that acts by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase. It is indicated for treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Legionella pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex disease, and Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Metronidazole is an amino nitroimidazole derivative that binds to iron and causes formation of free radicals that kill microorganisms. It is active against Trichomonas vaginalis, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Helicobacter pylori, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and many anaerobic gram-negative rods.
Diagnosis: Genital warts
Drug of choice: Imiquimod

"A 71-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her daughter for evaluation of her mental status. The daughter says, ""I visited Mom today for the first time in 6 months; her memory has worsened, her bills are unpaid, and her house is unusually messy."" The patient says, ""I'm perfectly healthy."" Medical history is significant for hypertension diagnosed more than 25 years ago, and two small strokes occurring 3 years and 7 months ago. The daughter gives you three empty medicine bottles from her mother's home: metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and aspirin. The patient is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 76/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 196/112 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Muscle strength in her left hand is 1/5. Strength in the right extremities is 4/5. The patient is oriented only to self; she does not know the day of the week or today's date. She recalls 0 of 3 words at 5 minutes, and she is unable to name 2 objects, correctly draw interlocking pentagons, or count backwards by serial sevens. Complete blood count, renal function studies, liver function studies, and urinalysis are all within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms?
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration or Neurosyphilis or Vascular dementia.","### Answer: Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration
### Explanation: This patient has vascular dementia due to lacunar infarcts affecting the deep white matter of the brain. Her presentation is consistent with cortical basal ganglionic degeneration. Patients typically have a gradual decline over several years, although rapid deterioration can occur after a stroke. Cognitive impairment includes difficulty with concentration, language, and visuospatial skills. Motor deficits include rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and gait disturbance. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would be associated with muscular weakness that progresses rapidly. Neurosyphilis presents with focal neurologic findings including meningitis, cranial nerve palsies, and paresis. Lewy body disease causes fluctuating cognition, hallucination, and Parkinsonism features. Frontotemporal lobe dementia results in personality changes, behavioral disturbances, and language disorders.

"A 17-year-old girl has never had a menstrual period. Physical examination shows a normal female body habitus, normal breast development, and normal appearing external genitalia. She has no axillary or pubic hair. The patient refuses to have a pelvic or rectal examination. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the clinical presentation?
Androgen insensitivity or Congenital adrenal hyperplasia or Ectodermal dysplasia or A psychiatric disorder.","### Answer: Androgen insensitivity
### Explanation: In this case, there is an XY karyotype (male), but all physical findings suggest that the individual is phenotypically female. This condition is known as testicular feminization syndrome or androgen insensitivity syndrome. It results from mutations in the androgen receptor gene on chromosome Xq10. There is a failure of masculinization due to resistance to androgens within the gonads. Gonadal tissue develops normally; however, because it does not respond to androgens, the gonad produces estrogens, which cause mullerian structures to form. Because these patients lack functional male internal and external genitalia, they cannot reproduce sexually. They can be distinguished from individuals who have congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH would result in virilization rather than feminization. Individuals with ectodermal dysplasias typically present with multiple abnormalities involving teeth, nails, bones, skin, and hair. Psychiatric illnesses tend to manifest themselves during late childhood or early adult life.

Chapter 6
Testosterone and Its Role in Male Health

The hormone testosterone plays a crucial role in male sexual function and secondary sex characteristics. Testosterone levels vary throughout the day and also change over time. For example, testosterone levels increase between ages 20 and 60 years before decreasing again after age 60.

What Is Normal Range for Testosterone Levels?
Normal range for total serum testosterone varies depending upon laboratory reference values used by different institutions. However, generally accepted ranges include:

Adult males: 300–1000 ng/dL
Older males: 200–800 ng/dL
Young boys: <200 ng/dL

Free testosterone level is measured using equilibrium dialysis method. Free testosterone represents only bioavailable fraction of testosterone. Normal free testosterone level is approximately 90 pg/mL.

How Do We Measure Testosterone Levels?
There are several ways to measure testosterone levels. These methods include:

Blood tests: Blood samples are taken either from veins or capillaries. Capillary blood sampling is less accurate compared to venous sampling.
Urine testing: Urinary testosterone measurement requires collection of urine sample first thing in morning when concentration of testosterone is highest.
Saliva testing: Salivary testosterone measurements require saliva samples collected just before waking up in the morning.

Which Method Is Best?
Each of these methods has its advantages and limitations. Venous blood draw provides best estimate of circulating testosterone levels. However, it is invasive procedure requiring needles and syringes. Therefore, many physicians prefer noninvasive methods like saliva or urine testing.

Saliva testing measures free testosterone levels. However, it is affected by diurnal variation and therefore is not recommended for diagnosis of hypogonadism.
Urine testing measures both bound and unbound testosterone. Unlike plasma testosterone, urinary testosterone concentrations show little diurnal variation. However, urinary testosterone levels are lowered if man drinks large amount of water before collecting urine specimen.

Measurement of Total Serum Testosterone
Total serum testosterone is usually measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). RIA uses labeled tracers to detect specific antibody binding sites. Tracers bind specifically to antibodies raised against testosterone molecule. Radioactive label allows detection of bound complexes.

Measurement of Free Testosterone
Free testosterone is measured using equilibrium dialysis method. Equilibrium dialysis involves separation of protein-bound and free fractions",Androgen insensitivity

Lumbar puncture reveals a protein level of 89 mg/dL (reference range: 15-45 mg/dL) with pleocytosis. The most likely etiologic organism is
Clostridium perfringens or Haemophilus influenzae or rhinovirus or Streptococcus pneumoniae.","### Answer: Clostridium perfringens
### Explanation: This patient has meningitis caused by C. perfringens. It can be associated with gas gangrene, which occurs after trauma that causes contamination of open wounds. Gas gangrene produces an odor described as ""rotten cabbage."" Meningitis due to H. influenzae usually follows otitis media. Rhinoviruses cause common colds and bronchitis but not meningitis. S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of community acquired bacterial meningitis.

### Explanation: This patient has invasive cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV DNA can be detected in up to 98% of all cases of cervical cancer. There are over 100 types of HPV; however, only high-risk serotypes (such as 16, 18, 31, and 33) cause neoplastic transformation. These oncogenic strains encode two major proteins: E6 and E7. E6 binds to and degrades tumor suppressor protein p53, which normally induces apoptosis when there is irreversible damage to cells. E7 encodes a protein that binds retinoblastoma gene product Rb, thereby preventing its phosphorylation and subsequent release into the nucleus where it would inhibit transcription factors necessary for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. High-risk HPV strains have been found in 90% of women who develop cervical dysplasia and 100% of those who progress to invasive cancer. Low-risk strains (types 6 and 11), which cause condylomas, rarely progress to cancer. Type 16 HPV is associated with 50% of cervical cancers worldwide. Other risk factors include multiple sexual partners, smoking, poor nutrition, and chronic inflammation. Diagnosis is made by colposcopy followed by biopsy of suspicious areas. Treatment consists of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or combination regimens. Vaccines against HPV strains 16, 18, 31, and 33 are available for young girls before they become sexually active.
Option B: Integration of viral DNA into host chromosome occurs in herpesviruses, not HPV. Option C: Viral replication does not occur via lytic cycles but rather via lysogenic conversion. Option D: Tax protein is encoded by HTLV-I and activates transcription of viral genes.

"A 52-year-old woman has had dyspnea and hemoptysis for 1 month. She has a history of rheumatic fever as a child and has had a cardiac murmur since early adulthood. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 130/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is not increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space. An x-ray of the chest shows left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?
Aortic valve insufficiency or Aortic valve stenosis or Mitral valve insufficiency or Mitral valve stenosis.","### Answer: Mitral valve insufficiency
### Explanation: This patient has mitral regurgitation due to chronic myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets. In this condition, there is no obstruction but rather failure of the valves to close completely during systole. As a result, blood flows backward into the left atrium from the left ventricle during diastole. Over time, the left atrium becomes dilated and hypertrophied, leading to impaired functioning of the lungs because of compression of the pulmonary veins. Left atrial enlargement leads to formation of thrombi that can embolize to other sites within the body. Pulmonary edema occurs when the pulmonary capillaries become overwhelmed by excess fluid. Dilation of the left side of the heart causes decreased forward flow through the right side of the heart, which results in congestive hepatomegaly. Chronic severe MR can lead to atrial fibrillation, which predisposes patients to stroke.Diagnosis: Mitral valve prolapse
Ref : Harrison&;s Principles of Internal Medicine 19e pg 1443
​

Most common cause of acute MR is infectious endocarditis.
The most common cause of chronic MR is myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve.
MR is associated with a high risk of systemic embolism.
In patients with MR, the LV outflow tract area is normal or small compared with the LA size.
The ECG typically reveals left axis deviation and left bundle branch block.
Echocardiography demonstrates the typical ""fish mouth"" appearance of the mitral valve leaflet.
Transesophageal echocardiography is indicated if transvalvular gradient > 20 mmHg.
Treatment includes anticoagulation, restoration of sinus rhythm, and surgical repair or replacement of the mitral valve.

​

Aortic valve stenosis

This disease is characterized by narrowing of the aortic valve orifice.
It is caused by calcification of the cusps, resulting in thickening and rigidity of the valve.
Patients present with exertional angina pectoris, syncope, and CHF.
The classic murmur of AS is a mid-to late-diastolic murmur best heard at the second right intercostal space.
The intensity of the murmur increases with inspiration and squatting.
The murmur is higher pitched than that of MS.
The first sign of AS on physical examination is a harsh systolic ejection sound.
AS is often accompanied by aortic root dilatation.
Left ventricular hyperophy develops as a consequence of the increase in left ventricular afterload.
The ECG usually shows left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diagnosis is made by echocardiography.
Treatment consists of medical therapy, balloon valvotomy, or aortic valve replacement.

Mitral valve stenosis

MS is characterized by narrowing of the mitral valve orifice.
It is caused by fibrosis of the mitral valve leaflets.
The pathogenesis of MS involves inflammation and scarring of the mitral valve apparatus.
The clinical presentation varies depending upon the severity of the stenosis.
With mild MS, symptoms occur only with exercise.
Moderate MS presents with fatigue, weakness, and dyspnea on exertion.
Severe MS is associated with NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms.
Physical examination reveals a loud, high-pitched, blowing holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal margin.
The murmur intensifies with inspiration and squatting.
The murmur is preceded by a soft S1.
There is also a mid-to-late diastolic murmur over the apical region.
The presence of an S3 gallop indicates elevated intracavitary pressures.
An accentuated P2 is indicative of RV enlargement.
The ECG shows right axis detion, tall peaked P waves, and ST segment depression.
Diagnosis is made by echocardiography.
Treatment consists of medical therapy, percutaneous commissurotomy, or open mitral",Mitral valve stenosis
"A 16-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by emergency medical technicians because of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that began 25 minutes ago and has continued despite administration of 0.5 mg/kg rectal diazepam 10 minutes ago. The patient was at home at the time of the seizure. In the emergency department, she is given an additional 0.5 mg/kg dose of diazepam intravenously and the convulsion terminates. Within 2 minutes, her oxygen saturation drops to 75% and she appears cyanotic. Respirations are 10/min and shallow. She receives bag-valve-mask ventilation, followed by intubation and mechanical ventilation. Medical history is unremarkable. She takes no medications. Temperature is 39.1°C (102.5°F). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency?
Airway occlusion or Encephalitis or Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive or Meningitis.","### Answer: Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive
### Explanation: This child had a febrile seizure complicated by status epilepticus. Diazepam can suppress the central respiratory center; this effect is particularly pronounced when benzodiazepine receptors are desensitized from previous use of these drugs. Airway obstruction would not be expected after treatment with diazepum. Although encephalitis could lead to coma, it does not explain the sudden onset of respiratory failure. Meningitis usually leads to fever and headache but rarely causes acute respiratory distress. Pneumonia typically presents with cough, dyspnea, and chest pain.
Diagnosis: Status epilepticus, drug-induced respiratory depression
Treatment: Mechanical ventilation

"A 7-year-old male is brought to the office for evaluation of school problems. The mother says that the teacher has told her that the patient is inattentive, has difficulty following sequential instructions, and often seems to drift off to sleep during class. A polysomnogram reveals obstructive sleep apnea. The most appropriate management is
elevation of the head of the bed or heart rate and apnea monitoring or imipramine or surgical evaluation.","### Answer: elevation of the head of the bed
### Explanation: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which occurs when there is obstruction of the upper airway, can be associated with attention deficits and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). OSA results from collapse of the soft tissues in the pharynx during sleep. This causes intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia, both of which stimulate arousal centers in the brain. In children, this leads to daytime somnolence and decreased concentration. Treatment consists of weight loss, avoidance of sedatives, and elevation of the head of the bed. Surgery is indicated if these measures fail.
The other choices would not treat the underlying cause of ADHD symptoms.

A Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Ceftriaxone or Clindamycin or Erythromycin or Metronidazole.","### Answer: Ceftriaxone
### Explanation: This patient has meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitides. Although this organism can be isolated from patients who have recovered from meningitis, it is also found frequently in the nasopharynx of otherwise healthy individuals. Infection occurs when these carriers come into contact with susceptible hosts; therefore, vaccination against N. meningitides is recommended only for those living in close quarters, such as military recruits. Meningococcemia often follows meningitis. Treatment consists of antibiotics effective against both N. meningitides and S. pneumoniae because co-infections occur commonly. Penicillins are first line agents, although cephalosporins are alternatives if penicillin allergy exists. Rifampin is added for treatment of meningococcemias. Clindamycin is used for treatment of group B streptococcal disease. Erythromycin is used for treatment of Legionella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Borrelia burgdorferi infections. Metronidazole is used for treatment of Trichomonas vaginitis, amebiasis, Giardia lamblia, and Helicobacter pylori infections.

"A 55-year-old man has had crushing substernal chest pain on exertion over the past 6 weeks. He had a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a β-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?
Decreasing myocardial contractility or Dilating the coronary arteries or Peripheral vasodilation or Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs.","### Answer: Decreasing myocardial contractility
### Explanation: In patients who have experienced an MI, there is increased risk of sudden death from ventricular tachycardia (VT). This can be prevented by treatment with a β-blocker that decreases myocardial contractility. Nitrates dilate coronary vessels but would not decrease mortality. Aspirin prevents thrombus formation but does not affect survival after an acute event. Calcium channel blockers also reduce mortality but only if started within the first few days of an acute event.
Diuretics increase cardiac output by reducing venous pressure; however, they do not alter mortality rates.
Amiodarone prolongs QT interval and increases mortality.
Digitalis increases mortality.
ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and decrease mortality.
Nifedipine relaxes vascular smooth muscle and lowers blood pressure.
Losaan reduces mortality.
Enalapril decreases mortality.
Metoprolol blocks β receptors and decreases mortality.
Diltiazem decreases mortality.
Verapamil decreases mortality.
Clopidogrel inhibits ADP receptor activation and prevents platelet aggregation.
Esmolol shortens action potential duration and decreases mortality.
Propranolol blocks β receptors and decreases mortality.
Bradycardia occurs when AV node conduction is blocked.
Hydralazine causes peripheral vasodilation.
Omeprazole decreases gastric acid production and prevents peptic ulcers.
Ranitidine decreases gastric acid secretion and prevents peptic ulcers.
Magnesium sulfate decreases neuromuscular excitability and seizures.
Furosemide decreases extracellular fluid volume and edema.
Spironolactone acts like aldosterone antagonist and decreases sodium and water retention.
Albuterol stimulates β receptors and bronchodilation.
Theophylline stimulates mucociliary clearance and improves lung function.
Prednisone decreases inflammation and swelling.
Glucocorticoids act as antiinflammatory agents.
Thiamine deficiency leads to Wernicke encephalopathy characterized by confusion, nystagmus, and horizontal nystagmus.
Zinc supplementation helps healing of wounds.
Calcitriol promotes calcium absorption and bone resorption.
Chloroquine binds to DNA and RNA and interferes with protein synthesis.
Cyclosporine suppresses T cell proliferation and differentiation.
Levofloxacin inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and prevents bacterial replication.
Amoxicillin inhibits penicillin binding proteins and prevents bacterial growth.
Penicillin G inhibits crosslinking of peptides and prevents bacterial growth.
Cefazolin inhibits cell wall synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.
Ceftriaxone inhibits cell wall synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.
Cephalexin inhibits cell wall synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.
Ciprofloxacin inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and prevents bacterial replication.
Clindamycin inhibits protein synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.
Azithromycin inhibits ribosome translocation and prevents bacterial growth.
Meropenem inhibits cell wall synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.
Imipenem inhibits cell wall synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.
Clarithromycin inhibits protein synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.
Tobramycin inhibits protein synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.
Minocycline inhibits protein synthesis and prevents bacterial growth.

"A 78-year-old man, who underwent coronary angiography with stent placement 8 years ago, comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Decrease the dose of metoprolol or Increase the dose of prednisone or Obtain serum vitamin D concentration or Order a transthoracic echocardiography.","### Answer: Decrease the dose of metoprolol
### Explanation: This elderly male presents with a longstanding murmur, which started after increasing the duration of walking. His vital signs are stable. There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on auscultation. Metoprolol decreases the force of contraction and can worsen preexisting valvular lesions. It is important to decrease the dosage of beta blockers in patients older than 50 years old because they have a higher risk of developing decompensated CHF due to their aging cardiovascular system. Prednisone is used in polymyalgia rheumatica; however, its use must be tapered gradually over several weeks. Vitamin D deficiency does not cause a murmur. Transthoracic echocardiogram would show the presence of mitral regurgitation if present.
Diagnosis: Mitral regurgitation
Treatment: Decreasing the dose of metoprolol
Drug therapy: Metoprolol
Reference: Harrison’s medicine-18th edition, page no: 1445, 1446
 

Key Concept:
In patients >50 yr old, decrease the dosage of beta blocker medication because these individuals have a high risk of developing decompensated CHF due to their aging cardiovascular system.

"A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?
Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy or Bereavement reaction or Early Parkinson disease or Increase in alcohol consumption.","### Answer: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
### Explanation: Fluoxetine can increase the severity of an existing tremor due to its anticholinergic side effects. This adverse effect usually resolves after discontinuing the drug. Alcohol withdrawal causes tremor; however, this patient increased her intake rather than decreasing it. Although bereaved individuals often experience physical symptoms including tremor, these typically resolve within several days. Patients with early parkinsonism have rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, and masklike facies. Hyperthyroidism presents with weight loss, nervousness, heat intolerance, tachycardia, diarrhea, and sweating. Hypothyroidism presents with fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance, dry skin, hoarseness, puffiness, and slow thinking.

She reports frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with different partners since she started college 4 months ago. Abdominal examination reveals suprapubic tenderness. Bimanual examination of the uterus reveals more intense tenderness. Swabs of cervical mucus are obtained. This patient should be given antimicrobial chemotherapy to provide treatment for
Candida albicans and Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis and Treponema pallidum or Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus species.","### Answer: Candida albicans and Chlamydia trachomatis
### Explanation: Patient has symptoms suggestive of acute PID (lower abdominal pain, dysuria, fever). On bimanual pelvic examination there was increased tenderness which suggests that it could be due to tuboovarian abscess.
Swab of cervical mucous can be taken from this pt. to rule out STD like chlamydia and candida.
Antibiotics used for both these organisms are fluconazole and metronidazole respectively.
So, option A is correct here.
Option C - Treatment of syphilis is penicillin G not Metronidazole.
Option D - Mobiluncus species causes bacterial vaginosis.
Option E - Neisseria gonorrhea is responsible for Gonococcal salpingitis.

"A 76-year-old man comes to the office because of early awakening at night. He has no difficulty falling asleep but routinely wakes up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. The patient is a retired postal worker, and he has always been physically active. He has diabetes mellitus controlled by diet. The patient drinks one cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast and usually walks for exercise in the morning. Before retiring at night he has one alcoholic beverage. He has no history of depression, nightmares, or snoring and he takes no over-the-counter medications. His wife of 45 years is also in good health. Vital signs are temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 96/min and regular, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-nourished, well-developed man. He is not obese. Examination of the head and neck is normal; there are no bruits or jugular venous distention. Chest is clear, and heart is normal with S1 and S2. Abdomen is soft and nontender with active bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Rectal examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's insomnia?
Advise the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol or Advise the patient to read and snack in bed to relax or Prescribe a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen or Prescribe sertraline.","### Answer: Advise the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol
### Explanation: Alcohol can cause sleep disturbance due to its stimulatory effect on CNS. It increases REM latency and decreases total sleep time. So it is best advised that the patient must avoid taking alcohol before going to bed.
Serotonergic drugs like trazodone and sertaline have sedative properties and thus used in treatment of insomnia. But they are contraindicated in patients who take MAOIs.
Reading and snacking in bed would increase the chances of developing insomnia.
Vigorous physical activity before bedtime causes increased body heat which leads to dissipation of heat during sleep. Thus it is avoided.
The husband does not complain of any symptoms related to OSAHS.
Diagnosis here is primary insomnia.
Treatment includes behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy and psychological intervention.
Psychological interventions include cognitive behavior therapy, hypnotics, biofeedback etc.
Pharmacologic agents include benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, antihistaminics etc.
Behavior therapies include stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation techniques, sleep hygiene education etc.
Benzodiazepines are the first line drug for short term use. Nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists are preferred for long term use.
Antipsychotic drugs are used only if other methods fail.

"A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician 3 months after she had a blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg at a routine examination prior to participation in school sports. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Exercise and weight reduction program or Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations or Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations or Captopril therapy.","### Answer: Captopril therapy
### Explanation: This patient has essential hypertension because her blood pressure is elevated despite multiple attempts to lower it through lifestyle modifications (exercise and diet). In addition, there is evidence that the high blood pressure is not due to secondary causes (elevated serum creatinine), nor is it related to hyperreninism (no family history of hypertension). There is also no evidence of pheochromocytoma (catecholamines or metanephrines were not measured). Although captopril can be used for pharmacologic testing of patients suspected of having pheochromocytoma, this drug would be effective treatment for this patient's hypertension. It acts by blocking angiotensin II receptors, which results in decreased aldosterone secretion and increased excretion of sodium and water. Therefore, captopril would reduce both systolic and diastolic pressures. If the patient does not respond to captopril, then an alternative antihypertensive agent could be tried.
Measuring cortisol levels would be useful if the patient had Cushing syndrome; however, this is unlikely based on the absence of clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency.
The patient's hematocrit is low, but this finding is unrelated to the cause of her hypertension.

"A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee. She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Nuclear scan of the right knee or MRI of the right knee or Antibiotic therapy or Arthrocentesis.","### Answer: Nuclear scan of the right knee
### Explanation: This patient has acute septic arthritis. Septic arthritis can be caused either by hematogenous spread from an infected focus elsewhere in the body or by direct contiguity between a wound and a joint surface. In children younger than age 6 months, the latter mechanism predominates. Although this patient injured her knee only recently, it is possible that bacteria entered through a small traumatic injury. The diagnosis is confirmed by nuclear scanning of the affected joint. Treatment includes antibiotics directed against likely pathogens and aspiration of the synovial fluid if necessary. Surgical drainage is indicated when there is persistent effusion despite adequate antibiotic treatment.
Antibiotic therapy alone would not confirm the diagnosis.
MRI of the right knee would provide excellent soft tissue resolution but would not detect any abnormalities related to the presence of bacteria within the joint space.
Arthrocentesis could be performed to obtain synovial fluid for culture and Gram stain, but it does not help establish the diagnosis.
Joint aspiration would allow examination of the synovial fluid, which might show leukocytes, crystals, or purulence, but it cannot confirm the diagnosis.
Aspirin would have little effect on the course of the condition.
Radionuclide imaging would demonstrate increased uptake of technetium in the joint due to inflammation.
Ultrasonography would reveal thickening of the capsule and synovium, but it would not confirm the diagnosis.
Bone scan would indicate osteomyelitis, but it would not confirm the diagnosis.
CT scan would provide detailed information regarding osseous structures, but it would not confirm the diagnosis.
X-ray of the right knee would show changes consistent with inflammation, but it would not confirm the diagnosis.
Plain radiographs of the spine would rule out other causes of back pain, but they would not confirm the diagnosis.
Ankle-brachial index would assess vascular integrity, but it would not confirm the diagnosis.
ECG would evaluate cardiac function, rhythm, and conduction, but it would not confirm the diagnosis.
Laboratory studies would include complete blood count, serum electrolyte levels, creatinine level, glucose concentration, C-reactive protein level, and urinalysis.
Hemogram would determine red cell counts, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, mean corpuscular volume, and reticulocyte count.
Serology would test for specific IgG and IgM antibodies to various organisms.
Culture would identify the causative agent.
Tissue biopsy would allow histologic analysis of the involved tissues.
Throat cultures would document the source of infection.
Abdominal ultrasound would evaluate the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, and spleen.
Chest CT scan would evaluate the lungs and mediastinum.
Rheumatoid factor would aid in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.
Muscle biopsy would allow muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration scoring.
Creatine kinase would assist in the differentiation of myositis.
Viral titers would quantify viral replication.
Monospot test would measure monocytopenia.
ESR would reflect systemic inflammation.
CRP would estimate the severity of inflammation.
Leukocyte esterase would detect neutrophil activation.
Procalcitonin would predict sepsis.
Differential white blood cell count would differentiate among granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes.
Plasma viscosity would assess coagulation status.
Fibrin degradation products would monitor fibrinolysis.
Prothrombin time would assess clotting ability.
Partial thromboplastin time would assess coagulation status.
Activated partial thromboplastin time would assess coagulation status.
Bleeding time would assess bleeding disorders.
Clot retraction time would assess platelet number.
Platelet aggregation assay would assess platelet function.
Coombs test would screen for autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
Direct Coombs test would screen for immunohemolytic anemia.

"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of a sore throat and fever that peaks in the late afternoon. He also has a 1-week history of progressive fatigue. He recently began having unprotected sexual intercourse with one partner. He appears ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy and pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Candidiasis or Herpangina or Infectious mononucleosis or Mumps.","### Answer: Infectious mononucleosis
### Explanation: Mono is caused by Epstein Barr virus which can be transmitted through saliva during kissing. It presents with symptoms similar to influenza but last longer. Cervical adenitis is common. Fever usually occurs in the evening. Diagnosis is made based on clinical features supplemented by serology. Treatment includes rest, hydration, analgesics, antipyretic medications, and antihistamines if needed. Antibiotics have no role.
Diagnoses associated with whitish patches include candidiasis, herpangina, mumps, and measles.
Diagnoses associated with swollen tonsils include acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, Ludwig angina, diphtheria, and Vincent’s angina.
Diagnoses associated with enlargement of the parotid gland include Sjogren syndrome, sarcoidosis, amylodotic disease, leukemia, and metastatic carcinoma.
Diagnoses associated with palatal petechiae include hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, scurvy, and meningococcemia.
Diagnoses associated with loss of taste sensation include zinc deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, syphilis, and HIV infection.
Diagnoses associated with foul breath include periodontal disease, denture stomatitis, and halitosis due to drugs.

"A 1-year-old male is brought to the emergency department with blistered fresh burns over his hands and feet in a stocking and glove distribution. His mother reports that he was accidentally burned when he turned on the hot water in the bathtub while she was answering the telephone in the bedroom. In addition to debridement of the burns, pain management, a thorough history and physical examination, and baseline laboratory studies, the most appropriate next step is to
administer a 5% albumin infusion or administer intravenous steroids or contact child protective services or discharge the patient home with his parents.","### Answer: contact child protective services
### Explanation: Burns covering >10% total body surface area (TBSA), especially if they involve the face, head, neck, perineum, genitalia, hands, feet, or joints, require immediate attention from an experienced physician. Children who have sustained these types of injuries often need hospitalization until their wounds can be adequately treated and covered. If there is evidence of neglect, abuse, or maltreatment, it is necessary to contact child protective services immediately.
Albumin administration is indicated only during acute illnesses associated with hypoproteinemia; this condition is not seen in patients with severe burns unless they develop sepsis. Steroids are used primarily to reduce edema and inflammation but would not be beneficial in this case because the burns were caused by heat rather than trauma. Child protective services must become involved whenever there is suspicion of neglect, abuse, or maltreatment.
The other options listed here are important parts of the initial care of any severely injured person, including those with burns. However, none of them requires reporting the situation to child protective services.

"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4°C (101.1°F) for 3 days. Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Increase the dosage of corticosteroids or Increase the dosage of cyclosporine or Begin amphotericin therapy or Begin ganciclovir therapy.","### Answer: Increase the dosage of cyclosporine
### Explanation: This patient has developed acute rejection after an uneventful renal transplantation procedure. Cyclosporine is used to prevent graft versus host disease but not to treat it once established. Graft versus host disease can be treated with increased immunosuppression using higher doses of cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Corticosteroid administration alone does not improve outcomes in patients who have already developed this complication. Amphotericin B is used against fungi that cause invasive infections. Ganciclovir is used to treat CMV retinitis.
Diagnosis: Acute rejection
Treatment: Increased immunosuppression
Drug of choice: Higher doses of cyclosporine or tacrolimus
Other drugs considered: Corticosteroids

"During a clinical study examining the effects of exercise, men between the ages of 20 and 30 years are evaluated during a 15- minute session on a treadmill. The average pulse for the last 2 minutes of the session is 175/min. During the last minute of exercise, various measurements are taken. Compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased?
Pulse pressure or Stroke volume or Systolic blood pressure or Total peripheral resistance.","### Answer: Pulse pressure
### Explanation: Increasing heart rate increases stroke volume and cardiac output but also reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP). As a result, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and total peripheral resistance remain relatively constant. Because DBP remains unchanged, pulse pressure would decrease.
Option B: Stroke volume is increased because of an increase in heart rate; therefore, it cannot be reduced.
Option C: SBP is decreased due to an increase in heart rate; therefore, it can be reduced.
Option D: Total peripheral resistance does not change significantly even though there is an increase in MAP.

"A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after he sustained a gunshot wound to the abdomen. His pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are normal on the right and decreased on the left. Abdominal examination shows an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line below the left costal margin. There is an exit wound laterally in the left axillary line at the 4th rib. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
CT scan of the chest or Intubation and mechanical ventilation or Peritoneal lavage or Left tube thoracostomy.","### Answer: CT scan of the chest
### Explanation: This patient has penetrating trauma from a bullet that entered his abdomen through the left upper quadrant and exited through the left axilla. He was hemodynamically unstable; therefore, intravenous fluids were started immediately. Although there is free air under the diaphragm (on the left side), this finding does not necessarily indicate pneumothorax because it could be due to bowel perforation. However, if the patient had no other signs of injury, then a simple pneumothorax would have been suspected initially. Because of the presence of free air under the diaphragm, a chest x-ray should be obtained first. If the chest x-ray reveals a large pneumothorax, then placement of a chest tube can be done. But if the chest x-ray fails to show any evidence of pneumothorax, then a contrast study of the abdomen must be performed to determine the extent of injuries. Therefore, the best initial test here is a chest CT scan.
Intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated when the patient becomes hypoxemic during the course of treatment. It is unlikely that the patient needs immediate intubation since he is still breathing spontaneously.
Peritoneal lavage is used only when there is gross contamination of the peritoneum. Since the patient did not have any external signs of peritonitis, this procedure is unnecessary.
Left tube thoracostomy is used primarily to drain a pneumothorax. Here, the chest x-ray failed to demonstrate a pneumothorax, and thus a chest tube would not be placed.
Right tube thoracostomy is rarely needed today except in cases where a large amount of bleeding into the pleural space requires evacuation.
A nasogastric tube is inserted to decompress the stomach. This procedure is usually reserved until the patient is stable enough to tolerate endoscopy.
An EGD is indicated when the patient develops severe hematemesis despite adequate volume replacement.
The FAST examination is useful in determining the source of active bleeding within the abdomen but cannot diagnose the cause of hypotension.
A laparotomy is indicated when the FAST examination demonstrates significant amounts of blood in the peritoneum.
A diagnostic peritoneal lavage is indicated when the FAST examination indicates free blood in the peritoneum but the patient remains hemodynamically stable.

"A 31-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, who is at 32 weeks' gestation, is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-week history of progressive dyspnea and wheezing. She says her heart is ""racing"" and she is coughing up a small amount of bloodstreaked sputum. Medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. An intravenous catheter is placed. Vital signs are temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 132/min, respirations 32/min, and blood pressure 135/78 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1. A grade 3/6, low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur is audible at the apex; a distinct snapping sound precedes the murmur. Fetal heart rate is 144/min. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the findings in this patient?
Chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease or Coarctation of the aorta or Congenital aortic stenosis or Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation.","### Answer: Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation
### Explanation: This patient has severe mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation causes increased stroke volume due to ventricular contraction against closed AV valves. Increased left atrial pressures lead to opening of the mitral valve during systole, causing a transient increase in cardiac output. However, when the mitral valve closes, there is again reduced forward flow through the hea. This results in a pulsatile, blowing, machinery-like murmur that is best heard over the tricuspid area. Chronic MR would not be associated with these symptoms until late pregnancy. Coarctation of the aorta would result in hypertension above and hypotension below the site of obstruction. Congenital aortic stenosis usually presents after infancy. Tricuspid stenosis would present with right-sided failure and edema.

### Explanation: This patient has cluster headaches that have been present since childhood but were previously undiagnosed. These attacks last from minutes to several hours and occur during sleep. They can be associated with ipsilateral nasal congestion and lacrimation. Patients often require high doses of oxygen therapy to relieve their symptoms. In contrast, migraines typically begin slowly and gradually worsen over several hours before reaching peak intensity within an hour. Meningitis would cause fever and meningeal signs; subarachnoid hemorrhage would result in loss of consciousness and neurological deficits.

"A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?
It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother or It is a polymorphism or It is a sequence variant of unknown significance or It will change the folding of the protein.","### Answer: It is a polymorphism
### Explanation: This child has a benign variant of a gene that causes an autosomal dominant disorder when there is another copy of the abnormal allele. In this case, both parents must be carriers of the abnormal allele; otherwise, they would have been identified earlier. If either parent had two copies of the abnormal allele, then the probability of having children affected by the condition would be high. However, if only one parent carries the abnormal allele, the chance of passing it on to offspring depends upon which parent contributes the normal allele. When the father passes his X chromosome to the daughter, he can pass along any number of genes located on the X chromosome. Because females inherit their X chromosome from each parent, males cannot determine which X chromosome was contributed by the mother. Thus, the fact that the mother is short compared to other family members suggests that she also inherited the abnormal allele from her own mother. Although the proband’s mother did not develop symptoms of Marfan syndrome, she could still transmit the abnormal allele to her son who might express the phenotype. The presence of the abnormal allele in the mother explains why the patient has a higher risk of developing Marfan syndrome. The single nucleotide change described here is a polymorphism, which means that it occurs frequently enough in the population that it is considered “normal.” Polymorphisms occur due to natural selection pressures acting over time. For example, sickle cell trait confers protection against malaria, so people living in areas where malaria is prevalent tend to carry the HbS allele. Similarly, the frequency of the TT genotype increases in populations exposed to chloroquine because these patients experience fewer relapses of malaria. Mutations are changes in DNA that alter the function of proteins encoded by those genes. They usually result in severe consequences, including death. Sequence variants of unknown significance are just that—they are unclassified variations in the DNA sequence that have yet to be linked to specific diseases. These types of variants often arise spontaneously during gametogenesis.
